{"abstract": "Processing long contexts presents a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements allow LLMs to handle much longer contexts than before (e.g., 32K or 128K tokens), it is computationally expensive and can still be insufficient for many applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered a promising strategy to address this problem. However, conventional RAG methods face inherent limitations because of two underlying requirements: 1) explicitly stated queries, and 2) well-structured knowledge. These conditions, however, do not hold in general long-context processing tasks.", "authors": ["Hongjin Qian", "Zheng Liu", "Peitian Zhang", "Kelong Mao", "Defu Lian", "Zhicheng Dou", "Tiejun Huang"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "MemoRAG: Boosting Long Context Processing with Global Memory-Enhanced Retrieval Augmentation", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05591"}
{"abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances their precision by incorporating external evidence from diverse sources like web pages, databases, and knowledge graphs. However, current RAG methods rely on agent-specific strategies for individual data sources, posing challenges low-resource or black-box environments and complicates operations when evidence is fragmented across sources. To address these limitations, we propose ER-RAG, a framework that unifies evidence integration across heterogeneous data sources using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. ER-RAG standardizes entity retrieval and relationship querying through ER-based APIs with GET and JOIN operations. It employs a two-stage generation process: first, a preference optimization module selects optimal sources; second, another module constructs API chains based on source schemas. This unified approach allows efficient fine-tuning and seamless integration across diverse data sources. ER-RAG demonstrated its effectiveness by winning all three tracks of the 2024 KDDCup CRAG Challenge, achieving performance on par with commercial RAG pipelines using an 8B LLM backbone. It outperformed hybrid competitors by 3.1% in LLM score and accelerated retrieval by 5.5X.", "authors": ["Yikuan Xia", "Jiazun Chen", "Yirui Zhan", "Suifeng Zhao", "Weipeng Jiang", "Chaorui Zhang", "Wei Han", "Bo Bai", "Jun Gao"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "ER-RAG: Enhance RAG with ER-Based Unified Modeling of Heterogeneous Data Sources", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06271"}
