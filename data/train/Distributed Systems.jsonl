{"abstract": "Maintaining consistent time in distributed systems is a fundamental challenge. The bittide system addresses this by providing logical synchronization through a decentralized control mechanism that observes local buffer occupancies and controls the frequency of an oscillator at each node. A critical aspect of bittide's stability and performance is ensuring that these elastic buffers operate around a desired equilibrium point, preventing data loss due to overflow or underflow. This paper introduces a novel method for centering buffer occupancies in a bittide network using a technique we term frame rotation. We propose a control strategy utilizing a directed spanning tree of the network graph. By adjusting the frequencies of nodes in a specific order dictated by this tree, and employing a pulsed feedback controller that targets the buffer occupancy of edges within the spanning tree, we prove that all elastic buffers in the network can be driven to their desired equilibrium. This ordered adjustment approach ensures that prior centering efforts are not disrupted, providing a robust mechanism for managing buffer occupancy in bittide synchronized systems.", "authors": ["Sanjay Lall", "Tammo Spalink"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Buffer Centering for bittide Synchronization via Frame Rotation", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07044"}
