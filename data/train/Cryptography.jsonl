{"title": "Encryption scheme based on Automorphism Group of Hermitian Function Field with Homomorphic Encryption", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10747", "authors": ["Gennady Khalimov", "Yevgen Kotukh"], "created": "2025-04-16", "abstract": "This article proposes a comprehensive approach to implementing encryption schemes based on the automorphism group of the Hermitian function field. We utilize a three-parameter group with logarithmic representations outside the group's center. In this work, we enhance the Hermitian function field-based encryption scheme with homomorphic encryption capabilities, which constitutes a significant advantage of our implementation. Both the attack complexity and the encrypted message size are directly correlated with the order of the group."}
