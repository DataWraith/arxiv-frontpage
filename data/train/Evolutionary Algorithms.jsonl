{"abstract": "Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thus enhancing both the efficiency and interpretability of data analysis by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional representation. However, a notable challenge with current manifold learning methods is their lack of explicit functional mappings, crucial for explainability in many real-world applications. Genetic programming, known for its interpretable functional tree-based models, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Previous research leveraged multi-objective GP to balance manifold quality against embedding dimensionality, producing functional mappings across a range of embedding sizes. Yet, these mapping trees often became complex, hindering explainability. In response, in this paper, we introduce Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel approach that directly penalises tree complexity. Our new method is able to maintain high manifold quality while significantly enhancing explainability and also allows customisation of complexity measures, such as symmetry balancing, scaling, and node complexity, catering to diverse application needs. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that GP-EMaL is able to match the performance of the existing approach in most cases, while using simpler, smaller, and more interpretable tree structures. This advancement marks a significant step towards achieving interpretable manifold learning.", "authors": ["Ben Cravens", "Andrew Lensen", "Paula Maddigan", "Bing Xue"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14139"}

To test the interaction between the CPS software and the system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems, researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore, we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.", "authors": ["Claudio Mandrioli", "Seung Yeob Shin", "Domenico Bianculli", "Lionel Briand"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03330"}

For integration of the workforce, each machine also requires a worker to be present to process an operation which additionally affects the processing times. The resulting problem is called Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-W). The FJSSP has been approached with various problem representations, including Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Constrained Programming (CP), and Simulation-based Optimization (SBO). In the latter area in particular, there exists a large number of specialized Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Yet, the solvers are often developed for single use cases only, and validated on a few selected test instances, let alone compared with results from solvers using other problem representations. While suitable approaches do also exist, the design of the FJSSP-W instances is not standardized and the algorithms are hardly comparable. This calls for a systematic benchmarking environment that provides a comprehensive set of FJSSP(-W) instances and supports targeted algorithm development. It will facilitate the comparison of algorithmic performance in the face of different problem characteristics. The present paper presents a collection of 402 commonly accepted FJSSP instances and proposes an approach to extend these with worker flexibility. In addition, we present a detailed procedure for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms on these problem sets and provide suitable model representations for this purpose. We provide complexity characteristics for all presented instances as well as baseline results of common commercial solvers to facilitate the validation of new algorithmic developments.", "authors": ["David Hutter", "Thomas Steinberger", "Michael Hellwig"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16159"}

However, as nondominated solutions of a multi-objective optimisation problem can be enormous or infinitely many, it is desirable to provide the decision-maker with only a small, representative portion of all the nondominated solutions in the archive, thus entailing a truncation operation. Then, an important issue is when to truncate the archive. This can be done once a new solution generated, a batch of new solutions generated, or even using an unbounded archive to keep all nondominated solutions generated and truncate it later. Intuitively, the last approach may lead to a better result since we have all the information in hand before performing the truncation. In this paper, we study this issue and investigate the effect of the timing of truncating the archive. We apply well-established truncation criteria that are commonly used in the population maintenance procedure of MOEAs (e.g., crowding distance, hypervolume indicator, and decomposition). We show that, interestingly, truncating the archive once a new solution generated tends to be the best, whereas considering an unbounded archive is often the worst. We analyse and discuss this phenomenon. Our results highlight the importance of developing effective subset selection techniques (rather than employing the population maintenance methods in MOEAs) when using a large archive."}
{"abstract": "Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization.

In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries.

While prior research has benchmarked various optimization methods, their findings often lack generalizability to real-world, domain-specific problems, particularly in early building design optimization for energy performance. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for early design optimization, focusing on their ability to find near-optimal solutions within limited timeframes. Using a constrained case study, we compare a simple GA to two baseline methods, Random Search (RS) and Grid Search (GS), with each algorithm tested 10 times to enhance the reliability of the conclusions. Our findings show that while RS may miss optimal solutions due to its stochastic nature, it was unexpectedly effective under tight computational limits. Despite being more systematic, GS was outperformed by RS, likely due to the irregular design search space. This suggests that, under strict computational constraints, lightweight methods like RS can sometimes outperform more complex approaches like GA. As this study is limited to a single case under specific constraints, future research should investigate a broader range of design scenarios and computational settings to validate and generalize the findings.

ODE applies a multi-objective genetic algorithm to explore CNN-based hardware configurations, optimizing for latency and resource utilization by leveraging intra-layer parallelism. Given a CNN architecture and user-defined constraints, the hardware model is generated automatically. ODR enables runtime hardware adaptability by dynamically selecting between partial or full reconfigurable designs based on application requirements. This flexibility is essential for time-critical, autonomous onboard systems. We demonstrate the proposed workflow on the Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA operating at 200 MHz, using CNN models trained on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10.

Through energy-aware production planning, manufacturers can align their energy demand with dynamic grid conditions, supporting renewable energy integration while benefiting from lower prices and reduced emissions. Energy-aware production planning can be modeled as a multi-criteria scheduling problem, where the objectives extend beyond traditional metrics like makespan or required workers to also include minimizing energy costs and emissions. Due to market dynamics and the NP-hard multi-objective nature of the problem, evolutionary algorithms are widely used for energy-aware scheduling.

Although this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to premature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a neuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of evolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with gradient-based tuning of the network's parameters. Due to the inherent high computational demand of evolutionary algorithms, it is not feasible to learn the parameters of every candidate NN topology to full convergence.
