{"abstract": "Brain-body co-optimization suffers from fragile co-adaptation where brains become over-specialized for particular bodies, hindering their ability to transfer well to others. Evolutionary algorithms tend to discard such low-performing solutions, eliminating promising morphologies. Previous work considered applying MAP-Elites, where niche descriptors are based on morphological features, to promote better search over morphology space. In this work, we show that this approach still suffers from fragile co-adaptation: where a core mechanism of MAP-Elites, creating stepping stones through solutions that migrate from one niche to another, is disrupted. We suggest that this disruption occurs because the body mutations that move an offspring to a new morphological niche break the robots' fragile brain-body co-adaptation and thus significantly decrease the performance of those potential solutions -- reducing their likelihood of outcompeting an existing elite in that new niche. We utilize a technique, we call Pollination, that periodically replaces the controllers of certain solutions with a distilled controller with better generalization across morphologies to reduce fragile brain-body co-adaptation and thus promote MAP-Elites migrations. Pollination increases the success of body mutations and the number of migrations, resulting in better quality-diversity metrics. We believe we develop important insights that could apply to other domains where MAP-Elites is used.", "authors": ["Alican Mertan", "Nick Cheney"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Controller Distillation Reduces Fragile Brain-Body Co-Adaptation and Enables Migrations in MAP-Elites", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06523"}
