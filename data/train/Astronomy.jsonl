{"abstract": "Recovering high-fidelity images of the night sky from blurred observations is a fundamental problem in astronomy, where traditional methods typically fall short. In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.", "authors": ["Yashil Sukurdeep", "Fausto Navarro", "Tam\\'as Budav\\'ari"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "AstroClearNet: Deep image prior for multi-frame astronomical image restoration", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06463"}
