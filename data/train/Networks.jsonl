{"abstract": "In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.", "authors": ["Yanfeng Hu", "Dongming Wang", "Xinjiang Xia", "Jiamin Li", "Pengcheng Zhu", "Xiaohu You"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "A Novel Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01111"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents a low power, low cost transceiver architecture to implement radar-on-a-chip. The transceiver comprises of a full ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter and a full UWB band receiver. A design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented. At the transmitter side, a sub-harmonic mixer is used for signal up-conversion. The receiver low noise amplifier (LNA) has a 2 to 6 GHz input matching bandwidth with a power gain of 9 dB and a noise figure of 2.5 dB. The transceiver is implemented in Cadence EDA tools using 65nm CMOS technology. The system achieves a total dc power consumption of 50 mW. Good noise figure performance; good wide-band matching; gain; high level of integration; low power; low cost of the proposed UWB radar transceiver front-end make it a highly competitive SoC solution for low power UWB transceivers.", "authors": ["Alin Thomas Tharakan", "Prince Philip", "Gokulan T.", "Sumit Kumar", "Gaurab Banerjee"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "A 2-6 GHz Ultra-Wideband CMOS Transceiver for Radar Applications", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06057"}
{"abstract": "The evolution of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has transformed the landscape of digital broadcasting by leveraging high-speed internet connectivity to deliver high-quality multimedia content. IPTV provides a dynamic and interactive television experience through managed networks, ensuring superior Quality of Service (QoS) compared to open-network Internet TV. This study explores the technical infrastructure of IPTV, including its network architecture, data compression techniques, and the role of protocols such as IGMP and RTSP. It also examines security challenges, including encryption, digital rights management (DRM), and authentication mechanisms that safeguard IPTV services from unauthorized access and piracy. Moreover, the paper analyzes the distinctions between IPTV and open-network Internet TV, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations in terms of service control, bandwidth optimization, and content security. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in IPTV enhances personalized content recommendations and predictive analytics, leading to improved user engagement and efficient network management. Additionally, emerging technologies such as 5G and cloud-based IPTV services are explored for their potential to further revolutionize the industry. While IPTV presents a robust alternative to traditional broadcasting, challenges such as bandwidth constraints, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory compliance remain significant. The study concludes that IPTV's future success will depend on advancements in network infrastructure, AI-driven optimizations, and strategic regulatory adaptations. As IPTV continues to evolve, hybrid models integrating IPTV and open-network streaming services are expected to enhance content accessibility, security, and overall user experience.", "authors": ["Georgios Giannakopoulos", "Peter Adegbenro", "Maria Antonnette Perez"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "The Future of IPTV: Security, AI Integration, 5G, and Next-Gen Streaming", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13450"}
{"abstract": "Mobility management in dense cellular networks is challenging due to varying user speeds and deployment conditions. Traditional 3GPP handover (HO) schemes, relying on fixed A3-offset and time-to-trigger (TTT) parameters, struggle to balance radio link failures (RLFs) and ping-pongs. We propose a data-driven HO optimization framework based on high-dimensional Bayesian optimization (HD-BO) and enhanced with transfer learning to reduce training time and improve generalization across different user speeds. Evaluations on a real-world deployment show that HD-BO outperforms 3GPP set-1 and set-5 benchmarks, while transfer learning enables rapid adaptation without loss in performance. This highlights the potential of data-driven, site-specific mobility management in large-scale networks.", "authors": ["Mohamed Benzaghta", "Sahar Ammar", "David L\\'opez-P\\'erez", "Basem Shihada", "Giovanni Geraci"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Data-Driven Design of 3GPP Handover Parameters with Bayesian Optimization and Transfer Learning", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02633"}
