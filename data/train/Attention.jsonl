{"abstract": "Both biological cortico-thalamic networks and artificial transformer networks use canonical computations to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this work, we propose that the structure of cortico-thalamic circuits is well suited to realize a computation analogous to multihead self-attention, the main algorithmic innovation of transformers. We start with the concept of a cortical unit module or microcolumn, and propose that superficial and deep pyramidal cells carry distinct computational roles. Specifically, superficial pyramidal cells encode an attention mask applied onto deep pyramidal cells to compute attention-modulated values. We show how to wire such microcolumns into a circuit equivalent to a single head of self-attention. We then suggest the parallel between one head of attention and a cortical area. On this basis, we show how to wire cortico-thalamic circuits to perform multihead self-attention. Along these constructions, we refer back to existing experimental data, and find noticeable correspondence. Finally, as a first step towards a mechanistic theory of synaptic learning in this framework, we derive formal gradients of a tokenwise mean squared error loss for a multihead linear self-attention block.", "authors": ["Arno Granier", "Walter Senn"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Multihead self-attention in cortico-thalamic circuits", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06354"}
{"abstract": "Transformers have driven remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision, yet their standard attention mechanism still imposes O(N^2) complexity, hindering scalability to longer sequences. We introduce Circular-convolutional ATtention (CAT), a Fourier-based approach that efficiently applies circular convolutions to reduce complexity without sacrificing representational power. CAT achieves O(NlogN) computations, requires fewer learnable parameters by streamlining fully-connected layers, and introduces no heavier operations, resulting in consistent accuracy improvements and about a 10% speedup in naive PyTorch implementations on large-scale benchmarks such as ImageNet-1k and WikiText-103. Grounded in an engineering-isomorphism framework, CAT's design not only offers practical efficiency and ease of implementation but also provides insights to guide the development of next-generation, high-performance Transformer architectures. Finally, our ablation studies highlight the key conditions underlying CAT's success, shedding light on broader principles for scalable attention mechanisms.", "authors": ["Yoshihiro Yamada"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "CAT: Circular-Convolutional Attention for Sub-Quadratic Transformers", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06704"}
{"title": "Learnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer: A Novel Alternative to Self-Attention", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08801", "authors": ["Andrew Kiruluta", "Priscilla Burity", "Samantha Williams"], "created": "2025-04-15", "abstract": "Transformer architectures, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art results across numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks by effectively modeling long-range dependencies. However, the computational complexity of self-attention, scaling quadratically with input sequence length, presents significant challenges for processing very long sequences or operating under resource constraints. This paper introduces the Learnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer (LMWT), a novel architecture that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a learnable multi-scale Haar wavelet transform module. Leveraging the intrinsic multi-resolution properties of wavelets, the LMWT efficiently captures both local details and global context. Crucially, the parameters of the wavelet transform, including scale-specific coefficients, are learned end-to-end during training, allowing the model to adapt its decomposition strategy to the data and task. We present the detailed mathematical formulation of the learnable Haar wavelet module and its integration into the transformer framework, supplemented by an architectural diagram. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a standard machine translation benchmark (WMT16 En-De), comparing the LMWT against a baseline self-attention transformer using metrics like BLEU score, perplexity, and token accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity, highlighting the linear scaling of our approach, discuss its novelty in the context of related work, and explore the interpretability offered by visualizing the learned Haar coefficients. Our results indicate that the LMWT achieves competitive performance while offering substantial computational advantages, positioning it as a promising and novel alternative for efficient sequence modeling."}
