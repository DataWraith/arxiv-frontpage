{"abstract": "We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact the cloud-flock lattice, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, which is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Furthermore, we show that the configuration and cloud-flock lattice behave well under duality and direct sums, whereas the Whitney function does not contain enough information to behave well under taking direct sums. As an aside we show that every configuration of a matroid arises as a configuration of a q-matroid, whereas the converse is not true.", "authors": ["Heide Gluesing-Luerssen", "Benjamin Jany"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "The Cloud and Flock Polynomials of q-Matroids", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14984"}
{"abstract": "Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.", "authors": ["Chris Cama\\~no", "Ethan N. Epperly", "Joel A.

{"abstract": "We consider the semiring of abstract finite dynamical systems up to isomorphism, with the operations of alternative and synchronous execution. We continue searching for efficient algorithms for solving polynomial equations of the form $P(X) = B$, with a constant side B, with the goal of decomposing complex behaviors into simpler systems. Taking inspiration from the characterization of injective polynomials P over dynamical systems, which is based on a condition on the lengths of limit cycles of their coefficients, we introduce a more general notion of pseudo-injectivity by relaxing this constraint. We prove that the associated equations can be solved efficiently, even in certain cases where the input is encoded in an exponentially more compact way.", "authors": ["Antonio E. Porreca", "Marius Rolland"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Solving \"pseudo-injective\" polynomial equations over finite dynamical systems", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06986"}
{"abstract": "Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $A$ be a subset of $G \\times G$ which is corner-free, meaning that there are no $x, y \\in G$ and $d \\in G \\setminus \\{0\\}$ such that $(x, y)$, $(x+d, y)$, $(x, y+d) \\in A$. We prove that \\[|A| \\le |G|^2 \\cdot \\exp(-(\\log |G|)^{\\Omega(1)}).\\] As a consequence, we obtain polynomial (in the input length) lower bounds on the non-deterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. We also obtain the first \"reasonable'' lower bounds on the coloring version of the $3$-dimensional corners problem and equivalently the deterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 4-player Number-on-Forehead model.", "authors": ["Michael Jaber", "Yang P.
