{"abstract": "Non-convex Machine Learning problems typically do not adhere to the standard smoothness assumption. Based on empirical findings, Zhang et al. (2020b) proposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption, though it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for standard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of Federated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on additional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the literature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial participation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive assumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on the proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient clipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the Polyak-{\\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known results for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the theoretical insights.", "authors": ["Yury Demidovich", "Petr Ostroukhov", "Grigory Malinovsky", "Samuel Horv\\'ath", "Martin Tak\\'a\\v{c}", "Peter Richt\\'arik", "Eduard Gorbunov"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Methods with Local Steps and Random Reshuffling for Generally Smooth Non-Convex Federated Optimization", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02781"}
{"abstract": "As an emerging paradigm of federated learning, asynchronous federated learning offers significant speed advantages over traditional synchronous federated learning. Unlike synchronous federated learning, which requires waiting for all clients to complete updates before aggregation, asynchronous federated learning aggregates the models that have arrived in realtime, greatly improving training speed. However, this mechanism also introduces the issue of client model version inconsistency. When the differences between models of different versions during aggregation become too large, it may lead to conflicts, thereby reducing the models accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning version correction algorithm based on knowledge distillation, named FedADT. FedADT applies knowledge distillation before aggregating gradients, using the latest global model to correct outdated information, thus effectively reducing the negative impact of outdated gradients on the training process. Additionally, FedADT introduces an adaptive weighting function that adjusts the knowledge distillation weight according to different stages of training, helps mitigate the misleading effects caused by the poorer performance of the global model in the early stages of training. This method significantly improves the overall performance of asynchronous federated learning without adding excessive computational overhead. We conducted experimental comparisons with several classical algorithms, and the results demonstrate that FedADT achieves significant improvements over other asynchronous methods and outperforms all methods in terms of convergence speed.", "authors": ["Chaoyi Lu", "Yiding Sun", "Pengbo Li", "Zhichuan Yang"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Corrected with the Latest Version: Make Robust Asynchronous Federated Learning Possible", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04081"}
{"abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) often struggles with data heterogeneity due to the naturally uneven distribution of user data across devices. Federated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enables collaborative search for optimal model architectures tailored to heterogeneous data to achieve higher accuracy. However, this process is time-consuming due to extensive search space and retraining. To overcome this, we introduce FedMetaNAS, a framework that integrates meta-learning with NAS within the FL context to expedite the architecture search by pruning the search space and eliminating the retraining stage. Our approach first utilizes the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization to facilitate relaxation of the mixed operations in the search space. We then refine the local search process by incorporating Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, where a task-specific learner adapts both weights and architecture parameters (alphas) for individual tasks, while a meta learner adjusts the overall model weights and alphas based on the gradient information from task learners. Following the meta-update, we propose soft pruning using the same trick on search space to gradually sparsify the architecture, ensuring that the performance of the chosen architecture remains robust after pruning which allows for immediate use of the model without retraining. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FedMetaNAS significantly accelerates the search process by more than 50\\% with higher accuracy compared to FedNAS.", "authors": ["Xinyuan Huang", "Jiechao Gao"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Federated Neural Architecture Search with Model-Agnostic Meta Learning", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06457"}
{"abstract": "One global model in federated learning (FL) might not be sufficient to serve many clients with non-IID tasks and distributions. While there has been advances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they only provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can create a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models with automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global models can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the merging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server broadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs to send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of periodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global model, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data distribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds caused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID settings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in which FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including clustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.", "authors": ["Shutong Chen", "Tianyi Zhou", "Guodong Long", "Jing Jiang", "Chengqi Zhang"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "FedMerge: Federated Personalization via Model Merging", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06768"}
