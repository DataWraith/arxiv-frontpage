{"created": "2025-04-16", "title": "Optimal Intraday Power Trading for Single-Price Balancing Markets: An Adaptive Risk-Averse Strategy using Mixture Models", "abstract": "Efficient markets are characterised by profit-driven participants continuously refining their positions towards the latest insights. Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.", "authors": ["Robin Bruneel", "Mathijs Schuurmans", "Panagiotis Patrinos"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01215"}

The PDE is solved using the finite difference method. The extended Black-Scholes model and a machine learning-based LSTM model are developed and evaluated for pricing Google stock options. Both models were backtested using historical market data. While the LSTM model exhibited higher predictive accuracy, the finite difference method demonstrated superior computational efficiency. This work provides insights into model performance under varying market conditions and emphasizes the potential of hybrid approaches for robust financial modeling."}

This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample."}
{"created": "2025-04-15", "title": "MiMIC: Multi-Modal Indian Earnings Calls Dataset to Predict Stock Prices", "abstract": "Predicting stock market prices following corporate earnings calls remains a significant challenge for investors and researchers alike, requiring innovative approaches that can process diverse information sources. This study investigates the impact of corporate earnings calls on stock prices by introducing a multi-modal predictive model. We leverage textual data from earnings call transcripts, along with images and tables from accompanying presentations, to forecast stock price movements on the trading day immediately following these calls. To facilitate this research, we developed the MiMIC (Multi-Modal Indian Earnings Calls) dataset, encompassing companies representing the Nifty 50, Nifty MidCap 50, and Nifty Small 50 indices. The dataset includes earnings call transcripts, presentations, fundamentals, technical indicators, and subsequent stock prices. We present a multimodal analytical framework that integrates quantitative variables with predictive signals derived from textual and visual modalities, thereby enabling a holistic approach to feature representation and analysis. This multi-modal approach demonstrates the potential for integrating diverse information sources to enhance financial forecasting accuracy. To promote further research in computational economics, we have made the MiMIC dataset publicly available under the CC-NC-SA-4.0 licence. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature on market reactions to corporate communications and highlights the efficacy of multi-modal machine learning techniques in financial analysis.", "authors": ["Sohom Ghosh", "Arnab Maji", "Sudip Kumar Naskar"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09257"}

{"created": "2025-04-18", "title": "Predicting Stock Prices using Permutation Decision Trees and Strategic Trailing", "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT) and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index. We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12 days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period. All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss of 2.2508 %.", "authors": ["Vishrut Ramraj", "Nithin Nagaraj", "Harikrishnan N B"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12828"}

Motivated by empirical evidence of regime-dependent volatility behavior and perceptual time dilation during financial crises, we develop a regime-switching framework based on the Modified Lognormal Power-Law distribution. Analysis of the FCIX from January 1990 to December 2023 identifies three distinct market regimes, low-chaos, intermediate-chaos, and high-chaos, each characterized by differing levels of systemic stress, statistical dispersion and persistence characteristics. Building upon the segmented regime structure, we further examine the informational forces that shape forward-looking market expectations. Using sentiment-based predictors derived from the Equity Market Volatility tracker, we employ an elastic net regression model to forecast implied volatility, as proxied by the VIX index. Our findings indicate that shifts in macroeconomic, financial, policy, and geopolitical uncertainty exhibit strong predictive power for volatility dynamics across regimes. Together, these results offer a unified empirical perspective on how systemic uncertainty governs both the realized evolution of financial markets and the anticipatory behavior embedded in implied volatility measures.", "authors": ["Masoud Ataei"], "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18958"}

Using eight years of historical data from B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange) collected via web scraping, a deep learning model was trained using a custom built hybrid loss function that incorporates market data and analytical pricing. The data for training and testing were drawn between the period spanning November 2016 to January 2025, using an 80-20 train-test split. The test set consisted of data from the final three months: November, December, and January 2025. The deep residual network model achieved a 64.3\\% reduction in the mean absolute error for the 3-19 BRL (Brazilian Real) range when compared to the Black-Scholes model on the test set. Furthermore, unlike the Black-Scholes solution, which tends to decrease its accuracy for longer periods of time, the deep learning model performed accurately for longer expiration periods. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in financial modeling, with future work focusing on specialized models for different price ranges.", "authors": ["Joao Felipe Gueiros", "Hemanth Chandravamsi", "Steven H.
