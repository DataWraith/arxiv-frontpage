The PDE is solved using the finite difference method. The extended Black-Scholes model and a machine learning-based LSTM model are developed and evaluated for pricing Google stock options. Both models were backtested using historical market data. While the LSTM model exhibited higher predictive accuracy, the finite difference method demonstrated superior computational efficiency. This work provides insights into model performance under varying market conditions and emphasizes the potential of hybrid approaches for robust financial modeling."}

This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample."}
