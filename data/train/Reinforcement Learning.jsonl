We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds."}
{"abstract": "Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms require large amounts of data, prohibiting their use in applications where frequent interactions with operational systems are infeasible, or high-fidelity simulations are expensive or unavailable. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators--such as reduced-order models, heuristic reward functions, or generative world models--can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for direct sim-to-real transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to form unbiased, reduced-variance estimators (control variates) for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework by developing multi-fidelity variants of two policy gradient algorithms: REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization. Experimental results across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark problems demonstrate that when target-environment samples are limited, MFPG achieves up to 3.9x higher reward and improves training stability when compared to baselines that only use high-fidelity data. Moreover, even when the baselines are given more high-fidelity samples--up to 10x as many interactions with the target environment--MFPG continues to match or outperform them. Finally, we observe that MFPG is capable of training effective policies even when the low-fidelity environment is drastically different from the target environment. MFPG thus not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.", "authors": ["Xinjie Liu", "Cyrus Neary", "Kushagra Gupta", "Christian Ellis", "Ufuk Topcu", "David Fridovich-Keil"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Multi-Fidelity Policy Gradient Algorithms", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696"}
{"abstract": "We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates Gradient Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based architecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems.

{"abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.", "authors": ["Kai Ye", "Hongyi Zhou", "Jin Zhu", "Francesco Quinzan", "Chengchung Shi"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784"}
{"abstract": "To apply reinforcement learning to safety-critical applications, we ought to provide safety guarantees during both policy training and deployment. In this work we present novel theoretical results that provide a bound on the probability of violating a safety property for a new task-specific policy in a model-free, episodic setup: the bound, based on a `maximum policy ratio' that is computed with respect to a `safe' base policy, can also be more generally applied to temporally-extended properties (beyond safety) and to robust control problems. We thus present SPoRt, which also provides a data-driven approach for obtaining such a bound for the base policy, based on scenario theory, and which includes Projected PPO, a new projection-based approach for training the task-specific policy while maintaining a user-specified bound on property violation. Hence, SPoRt enables the user to trade off safety guarantees in exchange for task-specific performance. Accordingly, we present experimental results demonstrating this trade-off, as well as a comparison of the theoretical bound to posterior bounds based on empirical violation rates.", "authors": ["Jacques Cloete", "Nikolaus Vertovec", "Alessandro Abate"], "created": "2025-04-11", "title": "SPoRt -- Safe Policy Ratio: Certified Training and Deployment of Task Policies in Model-Free RL", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06386"}
