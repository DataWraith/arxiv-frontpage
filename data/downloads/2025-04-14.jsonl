However, their application in professional domains remains under-explored. These specialized workflows introduce unique challenges for GUI perception models, including high-resolution displays, smaller target sizes, and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce ScreenSpot-Pro, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of MLLMs in high-resolution professional settings. The benchmark comprises authentic high-resolution images from a variety of professional domains with expert annotations. It spans 23 applications across five industries and three operating systems. Existing GUI grounding models perform poorly on this dataset, with the best model achieving only 18.9%. Our experiments reveal that strategically reducing the search area enhances accuracy. Based on this insight, we propose ScreenSeekeR, a visual search method that utilizes the GUI knowledge of a strong planner to guide a cascaded search, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% without any additional training.

However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%.

To date, there has been no comprehensive investigation into the specific ontology aspects or characteristics that affect the question generation process. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metrics for evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks in pedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology, a structured framework for deriving task-specific metrics, an expert-based approach is employed to assess the performance of various ontologies in Automatic Question Generation (AQG) tasks, which is then evaluated over a set of ontologies. Our results demonstrate that ontology characteristics significantly impact the effectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibiting varying performance levels.

While they can meet critical needs in modern society, concerns about their reliability and trustworthiness persist. In particular, Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek are becoming more accessible. However, such chatbots have limitations, including their inability to explain response generation, the risk of generating problematic content, the lack of standardized testing for reliability, and the need for deep AI expertise and extended development times. These issues make chatbots unsuitable for trust-sensitive applications like elections or healthcare. To address these concerns, we introduce SafeChat, a general architecture for building safe and trustworthy chatbots, with a focus on information retrieval use cases. Key features of SafeChat include: (a) safety, with a domain-agnostic design where responses are grounded and traceable to approved sources (provenance), and 'do-not-respond' strategies to prevent harmful answers; (b) usability, with automatic extractive summarization of long responses, traceable to their sources, and automated trust assessments to communicate expected chatbot behavior, such as sentiment; and (c) fast, scalable development, including a CSV-driven workflow, automated testing, and integration with various devices. We implemented SafeChat in an executable framework using the open-source chatbot platform Rasa. A case study demonstrates its application in building ElectionBot-SC, a chatbot designed to safely disseminate official election information.

While existing benchmarks have effectively identified social biases in LLMs, a critical gap remains in our understanding of the underlying reasoning that leads to these biased outputs. This paper goes one step further to evaluate the causal reasoning process of LLMs when they answer questions eliciting social biases. We first propose a novel conceptual framework to classify the causal reasoning produced by LLMs. Next, we use LLMs to synthesize $1788$ questions covering $8$ sensitive attributes and manually validate them. The questions can test different kinds of causal reasoning by letting LLMs disclose their reasoning process with causal graphs. We then test 4 state-of-the-art LLMs. All models answer the majority of questions with biased causal reasoning, resulting in a total of $4135$ biased causal graphs. Meanwhile, we discover $3$ strategies for LLMs to avoid biased causal reasoning by analyzing the \"bias-free\" cases. Finally, we reveal that LLMs are also prone to \"mistaken-biased\" causal reasoning, where they first confuse correlation with causality to infer specific sensitive group names and then incorporate biased causal reasoning.","authors":["Tian Xie","Tongxin Yin","Vaishakh Keshava","Xueru Zhang","Siddhartha Reddy Jonnalagadda"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07997"}

By leveraging geodesic paths, our method ensures smooth, topology-preserving, and interpretable deformations, capturing complex variations in image structures while maintaining geometric consistency. We validate the proposed IGG on plant growth data and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Current methods focus on balancing these two aspects at the network level, lacking sufficient differentiation and fine-grained control of individual neurons. To overcome this limitation, we propose Neuron-level Balance between Stability and Plasticity (NBSP) method, by taking inspiration from the observation that specific neurons are strongly relevant to task-relevant skills. Specifically, NBSP first (1) defines and identifies RL skill neurons that are crucial for knowledge retention through a goal-oriented method, and then (2) introduces a framework by employing gradient masking and experience replay techniques targeting these neurons to preserve the encoded existing skills while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Numerous experimental results on the Meta-World and Atari benchmarks demonstrate that NBSP significantly outperforms existing approaches in balancing stability and plasticity.","authors":["Jiahua Lan","Sen Zhang","Haixia Pan","Ruijun Liu","Li Shen","Dacheng Tao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08000"}

We achieve this through a self-bootstrapping scheme that optimizes prediction consistency between the test image (as target) and its deteriorated view. The key challenge lies in devising effective augmentations/deteriorations that: i) preserve the image's geometric information, e.g., object sizes and locations, which is crucial for TTA on object/pixel-level tasks, and ii) provide sufficient learning signals for TTA. To this end, we analyze how common distribution shifts affect the image's information power across spatial frequencies in the Fourier domain, and reveal that low-frequency components carry high power and masking these components supplies more learning signals, while masking high-frequency components can not. In light of this, we randomly mask the low-frequency amplitude of an image in its Fourier domain for augmentation. Meanwhile, we also augment the image with noise injection to compensate for missing learning signals at high frequencies, by enhancing the information power there. Experiments show that, either independently or as a plug-and-play module, our method achieves superior results across classification, segmentation, and 3D monocular detection tasks with both transformer and CNN models.","authors":["Shuaicheng Niu","Guohao Chen","Peilin Zhao","Tianyi Wang","Pengcheng Wu","Zhiqi Shen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08010"}

As such, it was considered to be essentially different from widely popular and acknowledged `utility-based methods', which build rankings from weight-averaged utility values. Nonetheless, TOPSIS has recently been shown to be a natural generalization of these `utility-based methods' on the grounds that the distances it uses can be decomposed into so called weight-scaled means (WM) and weight-scaled standard deviations (WSD) of utilities. However, the influence that these two components exert on the final ranking cannot be in any way influenced in the standard TOPSIS. This is why, building on our previous results, in this paper we put forward modifications that make TOPSIS aggregations responsive to WM and WSD, achieving some amount of well interpretable control over how the rankings are influenced by WM and WSD. The modifications constitute a natural generalization of the standard TOPSIS method because, thanks to them, the generalized TOPSIS may turn into the original TOPSIS or, otherwise, following the decision maker's preferences, may trade off WM for WSD or WSD for WM. In the latter case, TOPSIS gradually reduces to a regular `utility-based method'. All in all, we believe that the proposed generalizations constitute an interesting practical tool for influencing the ranking by controlled application of a new form of decision maker's preferences.","authors":["Robert Susmaga","Izabela Szczech"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08014"}

The realm of selective state space, exemplified by VMamba, demonstrates its global receptive field in representing the content. However, the way exploiting the domain-invariant property for selective state space is rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a novel Flow Factorized State Space model, dubbed as DG-Famba, for visual domain generalization. To maintain domain consistency, we innovatively map the style-augmented and the original state embeddings by flow factorization. In this latent flow space, each state embedding from a certain style is specified by a latent probability path. By aligning these probability paths in the latent space, the state embeddings are able to represent the same content distribution regardless of the style differences.

Compared with generic domain generalization, FGDG is particularly challenging in that the fine-grained category can be only discerned by some subtle and tiny patterns. Such patterns are particularly fragile under the cross-domain style shifts caused by illumination, color and etc. To push this frontier, this paper presents a novel Hyperbolic State Space Hallucination (HSSH) method. It consists of two key components, namely, state space hallucination (SSH) and hyperbolic manifold consistency (HMC). SSH enriches the style diversity for the state embeddings by firstly extrapolating and then hallucinating the source images. Then, the pre- and post- style hallucinate state embeddings are projected into the hyperbolic manifold. The hyperbolic state space models the high-order statistics, and allows a better discernment of the fine-grained patterns. Finally, the hyperbolic distance is minimized, so that the impact of style variation on fine-grained patterns can be eliminated.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Can Reasoning LLMs Enhance Clinical Document Classification?","abstract":"Clinical document classification is essential for converting unstructured medical texts into standardised ICD-10 diagnoses, yet it faces challenges due to complex medical language, privacy constraints, and limited annotated datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising improvements in accuracy and efficiency for this task. This study evaluates the performance and consistency of eight LLMs; four reasoning (Qwen QWQ, Deepseek Reasoner, GPT o3 Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking) and four non-reasoning (Llama 3.3, GPT 4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Deepseek Chat); in classifying clinical discharge summaries using the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using cTAKES to structure clinical narratives, models were assessed across three experimental runs, with majority voting determining final predictions. Results showed that reasoning models outperformed non-reasoning models in accuracy (71% vs 68%) and F1 score (67% vs 60%), with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking achieving the highest accuracy (75%) and F1 score (76%). However, non-reasoning models demonstrated greater stability (91% vs 84% consistency). Performance varied across ICD-10 codes, with reasoning models excelling in complex cases but struggling with abstract categories. Findings indicate a trade-off between accuracy and consistency, suggesting that a hybrid approach could optimise clinical coding. Future research should explore multi-label classification, domain-specific fine-tuning, and ensemble methods to enhance model reliability in real-world applications.","authors":["Akram Mustafa","Usman Naseem","Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08040"}

Due to a variety of reasons, including the stigma faced by people using opioids, online communities for recovery and support were formed on different social media platforms. In these communities, people share their experiences and solicit information by asking questions to learn about opioid use and recovery. However, these communities do not always contain clinically verified information. In this paper, we study natural language questions asked in the context of OUD-related discourse on Reddit. We adopt transformer-based question detection along with hierarchical clustering across 19 subreddits to identify six coarse-grained categories and 69 fine-grained categories of OUD-related questions. Our analysis uncovers ten areas of information seeking from Reddit users in the context of OUD: drug sales, specific drug-related questions, OUD treatment, drug uses, side effects, withdrawal, lifestyle, drug testing, pain management and others, during the study period of 2018-2021. Our work provides a major step in improving the understanding of OUD-related questions people ask unobtrusively on Reddit. We finally discuss technological interventions and public health harm reduction techniques based on the topics of these questions.","authors":["Tanmay Laud","Akadia Kacha-Ochana","Steven A.

We propose a new method to teach novices how to differentiate between nuanced categories in specialized domains. Our method uses generative models to visualize the minimal change in features to transition between classes, i.e., counterfactuals, and performs well even in domains where data is sparse, examples are unpaired, and category boundaries are not easily explained by text. By manipulating the conditioning space of diffusion models, our proposed method DIFFusion disentangles category structure from instance identity, enabling high-fidelity synthesis even in challenging domains. Experiments across six domains show accurate transitions even with limited and unpaired examples across categories. User studies confirm that our generated counterfactuals outperform unpaired examples in teaching perceptual expertise, showing the potential of generative models for specialized visual learning.","authors":["Mia Chiquier","Orr Avrech","Yossi Gandelsman","Berthy Feng","Katherine Bouman","Carl Vondrick"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08046"}

While extrinsic physical characteristics such as locomotion and pose can be accurately tracked in real-time, reliably capturing mental states is more challenging. Quantitative psychology allows considering more intrinsic features like emotion, attention, or cognitive load. Time perception, in particular, is strongly tied to users' mental states, including stress, focus, and boredom. However, research on objectively measuring the pace at which we perceive the passage of time is scarce. In this work, we investigate the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective measure of time perception in VR, exploring neural correlates with oscillatory responses and time-frequency analysis. To this end, we implemented a variety of time perception modulators in VR, collected EEG recordings, and labeled them with overestimation, correct estimation, and underestimation time perception states. We found clear EEG spectral signatures for these three states, that are persistent across individuals, modulators, and modulation duration. These signatures can be integrated and applied to monitor and actively influence time perception in VR, allowing the virtual environment to be purposefully adapted to the individual to increase immersion further and improve user experience.

However, traditional Quality-Diversity methods, such as MAP-Elites, rely heavily on predefined behavioral descriptors and complete prior knowledge of the task to define the behavioral space grid, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this work, we introduce Vector Quantized-Elites (VQ-Elites), a novel Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously constructs a structured behavioral space grid using unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. At the core of VQ-Elites is the integration of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, which enables the dynamic learning of behavioral descriptors and the generation of a structured, rather than unstructured, behavioral space grid - a significant advancement over existing unsupervised Quality-Diversity approaches. This design establishes VQ-Elites as a flexible, robust, and task-agnostic optimization framework. To further enhance the performance of unsupervised Quality-Diversity algorithms, we introduce two key components: behavioral space bounding and cooperation mechanisms, which significantly improve convergence and performance. We validate VQ-Elites on robotic arm pose-reaching and mobile robot space-covering tasks. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality solutions, emphasizing its adaptability, scalability, robustness to hyperparameters, and potential to extend Quality-Diversity optimization to complex, previously inaccessible domains.","authors":["Constantinos Tsakonas","Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08057"}

While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy transition, few provide an integrated framework that captures the full spectrum of impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive techno-economic, environmental, and social (TEES) assessment framework to evaluate energy transition pathways. The framework provides a structured methodology for assessing infrastructure needs, cost implications, emissions reductions, and social equity impacts, offering a systematic approach for informed decision-making. To illustrate its applicability, a detailed case study of a remote community in Alaska is conducted, evaluating the TEES impacts of three distinct energy transition pathways including heat pumps (HPs) and battery integration, resource coordination and expanded community solar photovoltaic (PV). Findings show that coordination of HPs minimizes peak demand, enhances grid reliability, and reduces energy burdens among low-income households. Extensive simulation-based analysis reveals that strategically staging electric HPs with existing oil heating systems can lower overall energy costs by 19% and reduce emissions by 29% compared to the today's system and outperforms all-heat-pump strategy for economic savings. By combining a generalizable, community-centric assessment framework with data-driven case study insights, this work offers a practical tool for utilities, community stakeholders and policymakers to work toward equitable and sustainable energy transitions.","authors":["Jayashree Yadav","Ingemar Mathiasson","Bindu Panikkar","Mads Almassalkhi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08060"}

Most of models use either independent modules to separately extract temporal and spatial correlations or joint modules to synchronously extract them, without considering the spatial-temporal correlations. Moreover, models that consider joint spatial-temporal correlations (temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal correlations) often encounter significant challenges in accuracy and computational efficiency which prevent such models from demonstrating the expected advantages of a joint spatial-temporal correlations architecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient pure convolutional network for traffic prediction via spatial-temporal encoding and inferring (STEI-PCN). The model introduces and designs a dynamic adjacency matrix inferring module based on absolute spatial and temporal coordinates, as well as relative spatial and temporal distance encoding, using a graph convolutional network combined with gating mechanism to capture local synchronous joint spatial-temporal correlations. Additionally, three layers of temporal dilated causal convolutional network are used to capture long-range temporal correlations. Finally, through multi-view collaborative prediction module, the model integrates the gated-activated original, local synchronous joint spatial-temporal, and long-range temporal features to achieve comprehensive prediction. This study conducts extensive experiments on flow datasets (PeMS03/04/07/08) and speed dataset (PeMS-Bay), covering multiple prediction horizons. The results show that STEI-PCN demonstrates competitive computational efficiency in both training and inference speeds, and achieves superior or slightly inferior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most evaluation metrics.","authors":["Kai Hu","Zhidan Zhao","Zhifeng Hao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08061"}

While prior research has benchmarked various optimization methods, their findings often lack generalizability to real-world, domain-specific problems, particularly in early building design optimization for energy performance. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for early design optimization, focusing on their ability to find near-optimal solutions within limited timeframes. Using a constrained case study, we compare a simple GA to two baseline methods, Random Search (RS) and Grid Search (GS), with each algorithm tested 10 times to enhance the reliability of the conclusions. Our findings show that while RS may miss optimal solutions due to its stochastic nature, it was unexpectedly effective under tight computational limits. Despite being more systematic, GS was outperformed by RS, likely due to the irregular design search space. This suggests that, under strict computational constraints, lightweight methods like RS can sometimes outperform more complex approaches like GA. As this study is limited to a single case under specific constraints, future research should investigate a broader range of design scenarios and computational settings to validate and generalize the findings.

Beyond generation, object-level image editing remains a challenging problem, requiring precise modifications while preserving visual coherence. Existing text-based instructional editing methods struggle with localized shape and layout transformations, often introducing unintended global changes.

To reduce this manual effort while maintaining a high image editing accuracy, in this paper, we propose POEM, a framework for Precise Object-level Editing using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). POEM leverages MLLMs to analyze instructional prompts and generate precise object masks before and after transformation, enabling fine-grained control without extensive user input. This structured reasoning stage guides the diffusion-based editing process, ensuring accurate object localization and transformation. To evaluate our approach, we introduce VOCEdits, a benchmark dataset based on PASCAL VOC 2012, augmented with instructional edit prompts, ground-truth transformations, and precise object masks.

To address this gap, we explore the scaling limits of GNNs for atomistic materials modeling by developing a foundational model with billions of parameters, trained on extensive datasets in terabyte-scale. Our approach incorporates techniques from LLM libraries to efficiently manage large-scale data and models, enabling both effective training and deployment of these large-scale GNN models.

The proposed method learns the relationship between the trigger signal and disturbance force, enabling the system to anticipate and counteract the impending disturbances before they occur. We train and evaluate three policies: a baseline policy trained without exposure to the disturbance, a reactive policy trained with the disturbance but without the trigger signal, and a predictive policy that incorporates the trigger signal as an observation and is exposed to the disturbance during training. Our simulation results show that the predictive policy outperforms the other policies by minimizing position deviations through a proactive correction maneuver. This work highlights the potential of integrating predictive cues into RL frameworks to improve UAS performance.","authors":["Kousheek Chakraborty","Thijs Hof","Ayham Alharbat","Abeje Mersha"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08114"}

In radar imaging, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), anomaly detection can be used for the classification, detection, and segmentation of objects of interest. However, there is no method for developing and benchmarking these methods on SAR imagery. To address this issue, we introduce SAR imagery anomaly detection (SARIAD). In conjunction with Anomalib, a deep-learning library for anomaly detection, SARIAD provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms and datasets for assessing and developing anomaly detection approaches on SAR imagery. SARIAD specifically integrates multiple SAR datasets along with tools to effectively apply various anomaly detection algorithms to SAR imagery. Several anomaly detection metrics and visualizations are available.

Prior research has shown that expressive robots can enhance child engagement during human-robot interactions. However, many robots used in therapy settings feature non-personalized, static faces designed with traditional facial feature considerations, which can limit the depth of interactions and emotional connections. Digital faces offer opportunities for personalization, yet the current landscape of robot face design lacks a dynamic, user-centered approach. Specifically, there is a significant research gap in designing robot faces based on child preferences. Instead, most robots in child-focused therapy spaces are developed from an adult-centric perspective. We present a novel study investigating the influence of child-drawn digital faces in child-robot interactions. This approach focuses on a design activity with children instructed to draw their own custom robot faces. We compare the perceptions of social intelligence (PSI) of two implementations: a generic digital face and a robot face, personalized using the user's drawn robot faces. The results of this study show the perceived social intelligence of a child-drawn robot was significantly higher compared to a generic face.","authors":["Denielle Oliva","Joshua Knight","Tyler J Becker","Heather Amistani","Monica Nicolescu","David Feil-Seifer"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08117"}

This study systematically compares reasoning-based LLMs (DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o3) with their non-reasoning counterparts across machine translation (MT) and text summarization (TS) evaluation tasks. We evaluate eight models across three architectural categories, including state-of-the-art reasoning models, their distilled variants (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters), and equivalent conventional, non-reasoning LLMs. Our experiments on WMT23 and SummEval benchmarks reveal that the benefits of reasoning capabilities are highly model and task-dependent: while OpenAI o3-mini models show consistent performance improvements with increased reasoning intensity, DeepSeek-R1 underperforms compared to its non-reasoning variant, with exception to certain aspects of TS evaluation. Correlation analysis demonstrates that increased reasoning token usage positively correlates with evaluation quality in o3-mini models. Furthermore, our results show that distillation of reasoning capabilities maintains reasonable performance in medium-sized models (32B) but degrades substantially in smaller variants (8B).

This example demonstrates the urgent need for focused, concise training on human-automation interaction - a need that is equally critical for operators of Level 2 ADAS-equipped vehicles, as discussed in detail later in this article. The lack of structured education for semi-automated vehicle operators mirrors similar risks in other industries, where formal training is critical for safe operation. Two policy recommendations are proposed. First, governments should create concise, official resources in accessible and official format to educate drivers on system capabilities and limitations. Second, mandatory training and certification programs should be introduced, combining theoretical and hands-on components to prepare drivers for real-world scenarios. These measures will improve driver understanding, reduce misuse, and foster public trust in semi-automated vehicle technologies.

Seminal attention-based models like TGAT and DyGFormer rely on sinusoidal time encoders to capture temporal relationships between edge events. In this paper, we study a simpler alternative: the linear time encoder, which avoids temporal information loss caused by sinusoidal functions and reduces the need for high dimensional time encoders. We show that the self-attention mechanism can effectively learn to compute time spans from linear time encodings and extract relevant temporal patterns. Through extensive experiments on six dynamic graph datasets, we demonstrate that the linear time encoder improves the performance of TGAT and DyGFormer in most cases. Moreover, the linear time encoder can lead to significant savings in model parameters with minimal performance loss. For example, compared to a 100-dimensional sinusoidal time encoder, TGAT with a 2-dimensional linear time encoder saves 43% of parameters and achieves higher average precision on five datasets.

To conceptualize the MEQC, we first design an MEQC system, where mobile devices can offload classical and quantum computation tasks to edge servers equipped with classical and quantum computers. We then formulate the hybrid classical-quantum computation offloading problem whose goal is to minimize system cost in terms of latency and energy consumption. To solve the offloading problem efficiently, we propose a hybrid discrete-continuous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to learn long-term sustainable offloading and partitioning strategies.

CAMP improves the processing efficiency of Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs). Matrix multiplication is a cornerstone of machine learning applications, and its quantized versions are increasingly popular for more efficient operations. Unfortunately, existing VAs and SIMD-support units struggle to efficiently handle these quantized formats. In this work, we propose CAMP, a simple yet effective architecture that leverages a hybrid multiplier. The CAMP architecture significantly advances the performance of vector architectures in handling quantized data, enabling more efficient execution of matrix multiplication across various platforms, specifically targeting the ARMv8 Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and edge RISC-V SIMD-based architectures. In addition to increasing throughput, CAMP's architectural design also contributes to energy efficiency, making it an effective solution for low-power applications. Evaluations on a range of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrate that matrix multiplication operations using the proposed micro-architecture achieve up to 17$\\times$ and 23$\\times$ performance improvements compared to their respective baselines, the ARM A64FX core and a RISC-V-based edge System-on-Chip (SoC).

However, the widespread adoption of LLMs presents several challenges, such as integration into existing applications and infrastructure, utilization of company proprietary data, models, and APIs, and meeting cost, quality, responsiveness, and other requirements. To address these challenges, there is a notable shift from monolithic models to compound AI systems, with the premise of more powerful, versatile, and reliable applications. However, progress thus far has been piecemeal, with proposals for agentic workflows, programming models, and extended LLM capabilities, without a clear vision of an overall architecture. In this paper, we propose a 'blueprint architecture' for compound AI systems for orchestrating agents and data for enterprise applications. In our proposed architecture the key orchestration concept is 'streams' to coordinate the flow of data and instructions among agents. Existing proprietary models and APIs in the enterprise are mapped to 'agents', defined in an 'agent registry' that serves agent metadata and learned representations for search and planning. Agents can utilize proprietary data through a 'data registry' that similarly registers enterprise data of various modalities. Tying it all together, data and task 'planners' break down, map, and optimize tasks and queries for given quality of service (QoS) requirements such as cost, accuracy, and latency.

In turn, collective minds are shaped by a continuous stream of influences, amplified by the rapid rise of online platforms. Online communities must understand these influences to maintain healthy discourse and avoid being manipulated, but understanding is hindered by limited observations and the inability to conduct counterfactual experiments. Here, we show how collective minds in online news communities can be influenced by different editorial agenda-setting practices and aspects of community dynamics, and how these influences can be reversed. We develop a computational model of collective minds, calibrated and validated with data from 400 million comments across five U.S. online news platforms and a large-scale survey. The model enables us to describe and experiment with a variety of influences and derive quantitative insights into their magnitude and persistence in different communities. We find that some editorial influences can be reversed relatively rapidly, but others, such as amplification and reframing of certain topics, as well as community influences such as trolling and counterspeech, tend to persist and durably change the collective mind. These findings illuminate ways collective minds can be manipulated and pathways for communities to maintain healthy and authentic collective discourse amid ongoing societal challenges.","authors":["Seungwoong Ha","Henrik Olsson","Kresimir Jaksic","Max Pellert","Mirta Galesic"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08152"}

We suggest that many core foundations of traditional RL are, in fact, antithetical to the goals of continual reinforcement learning. We enumerate four such foundations: the Markov decision process formalism, a focus on optimal policies, the expected sum of rewards as the primary evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. Shedding such sacredly held and taught concepts is not easy. They are self-reinforcing in that each foundation depends upon and holds up the others, making it hard to rethink each in isolation. We propose an alternative set of all four foundations that are better suited to the continual learning setting.

This is achieved by adding a new branch to selected attention layers that computes an auxiliary loss which we call the object-focused attention (OFA) loss. We restrict the attention to image patches that belong to the same object class, which allows ViTs to gain a better understanding of configural (or holistic) object shapes by focusing on intra-object patches instead of other patches such as those in the background. Our proposed inductive bias fits easily into the attention framework of transformers since it only adds an auxiliary loss over selected attention layers. Furthermore, our approach has no additional overhead during inference. We also experiment with multiscale masking to further improve the performance of our OFA model and give a path forward for self-supervised learning with our method. Our experimental results demonstrate that ViTs with OFA achieve better classification results than their base models, exhibit a stronger generalization ability to out-of-distribution (OOD) and adversarially corrupted images, and learn representations based on object shapes rather than spurious correlations via general textures.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Enhanced Cooperative Perception Through Asynchronous Vehicle to Infrastructure Framework with Delay Mitigation for Connected and Automated Vehicles","abstract":"Perception is a key component of Automated vehicles (AVs). However, sensors mounted to the AVs often encounter blind spots due to obstructions from other vehicles, infrastructure, or objects in the surrounding area. While recent advancements in planning and control algorithms help AVs react to sudden object appearances from blind spots at low speeds and less complex scenarios, challenges remain at high speeds and complex intersections. Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technology promises to enhance scene representation for AVs in complex intersections, providing sufficient time and distance to react to adversary vehicles violating traffic rules. Most existing methods for infrastructure-based vehicle detection and tracking rely on LIDAR, RADAR or sensor fusion methods, such as LIDAR-Camera and RADAR-Camera. Although LIDAR and RADAR provide accurate spatial information, the sparsity of point cloud data limits its ability to capture detailed object contours of objects far away, resulting in inaccurate 3D object detection results. Furthermore, the absence of LIDAR or RADAR at every intersection increases the cost of implementing V2I technology. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a V2I framework that utilizes monocular traffic cameras at road intersections to detect 3D objects. The results from the roadside unit (RSU) are then combined with the on-board system using an asynchronous late fusion method to enhance scene representation. Additionally, the proposed framework provides a time delay compensation module to compensate for the processing and transmission delay from the RSU. Lastly, the V2I framework is tested by simulating and validating a scenario similar to the one described in an industry report by Waymo. The results show that the proposed method improves the scene representation and the AV's perception range, giving enough time and space to react to adversary vehicles.","authors":["Nithish Kumar Saravanan","Varun Jammula","Yezhou Yang","Jeffrey Wishart","Junfeng Zhao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08172"}

Traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) struggle to detect highly obfuscated and complex attacks, as their rules require manual updates. This paper presents a novel generative AI framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance XSS mitigation. The framework achieves two primary objectives: (1) generating sophisticated and syntactically validated XSS payloads using in-context learning, and (2) automating defense mechanisms by testing these attacks against a vulnerable application secured by a WAF, classifying bypassing attacks, and generating effective WAF security rules. Experimental results using GPT-4o demonstrate the framework's effectiveness generating 264 XSS payloads, 83% of which were validated, with 80% bypassing ModSecurity WAF equipped with an industry standard security rule set developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to protect against web vulnerabilities. Through rule generation, 86% of previously successful attacks were blocked using only 15 new rules.

A Graph Attention Mechanism is employed to dynamically assign weights to different transaction relationships. Additionally, a Temporal Decay Mechanism is integrated to enhance the model's sensitivity to time-related fraud patterns. To address the scarcity of fraudulent transaction samples, this study applies SMOTE oversampling and Cost-sensitive Learning.

It is expected that FL will have a huge implication on Mobile Edge Computing, the Internet of Things, and Cross-Silo FL. In this paper, we focus on the widely used FedAvg algorithm to explore the effect of the number of clients in FL.

To address this issue for a general application, we propose a method called Knowledgeable Client Insertion (KCI) that introduces a very small number of knowledgeable clients to the MEC setting. These knowledgeable clients are expected to have accumulated a large set of data samples to help with training. With the help of KCI, the learning accuracy of FL increases much faster even with a normal FedAvg aggregation technique.

In particular, selecting one arm may influence the future rewards of other arms, a scenario not adequately captured by existing models such as rotting bandits or restless bandits. To address this limitation, we propose the influential bandit problem, which models inter-arm interactions through an unknown, symmetric, positive semi-definite interaction matrix that governs the dynamics of arm losses. We formally define this problem and establish two regret lower bounds, including a superlinear $\\Omega(T^2 / \\log^2 T)$ bound for the standard UCB algorithm and an algorithm-independent $\\Omega(T)$ bound, which highlight the inherent difficulty of the setting. We then introduce a new algorithm based on a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimator tailored to the structure of the loss dynamics. Under mild assumptions, our algorithm achieves a regret of $O(KT \\log T)$, which is nearly optimal in terms of its dependence on the time horizon. The algorithm is simple to implement and computationally efficient. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the presence of inter-arm influence and confirm the superior performance of our method compared to conventional bandit algorithms.","authors":["Ryoma Sato","Shinji Ito"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08200"}

In this work, we investigate how this intrinsic knowledge affects content generation and demonstrate that its impact becomes increasingly pronounced as context length extends. Furthermore, we show that the model's ability to utilize intrinsic knowledge, which we call intrinsic retrieval ability, does not improve simultaneously with its ability to leverage contextual knowledge through extrinsic retrieval ability. Moreover, better extrinsic retrieval can interfere with the model's ability to use its own knowledge effectively, limiting its full potential. To bridge this gap, we design a simple yet effective Hybrid Needle-in-a-Haystack test that evaluates models based on their capabilities across both retrieval abilities, rather than solely emphasizing extrinsic retrieval ability. Our experimental results reveal that Qwen-2.5 models significantly outperform Llama-3.1 models, demonstrating superior intrinsic retrieval ability.

However, big data application development and deployment remain challenging to accomplish in such environments. With the increasing containerization and modernization of big data applications, we argue that a unified control/management plane now makes sense for running these applications in hybrid cloud environments. To this end, we study the problem of building a generic hybrid-cloud management plane to radically simplify managing big data applications. A generic architecture for hybrid-cloud management, called Titchener, is proposed in this paper. Titchener comprises of independent and loosely coupled local control planes interacting with a highly available public cloud hosted global management plane. We describe a possible instantiation of Titchener based on Kubernetes and address issues related to global service discovery, network connectivity and access control enforcement. We also validate our proposed designs with a real management plane implementation based on a popular big data workflow orchestration in hybrid-cloud environments.","authors":["Vignesh Babu","Feng Lu","Haotian Wu","Cameron Moberg"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08225"}

This presents a critical gap for practical deployment, where user queries exhibit greater linguistic variations and can trigger cascading errors across interdependent RAG components. In this work, we systematically analyze how varying four linguistic dimensions (formality, readability, politeness, and grammatical correctness) impact RAG performance. We evaluate two retrieval models and nine LLMs, ranging from 3 to 72 billion parameters, across four information-seeking Question Answering (QA) datasets. Our results reveal that linguistic reformulations significantly impact both retrieval and generation stages, leading to a relative performance drop of up to 40.41% in Recall@5 scores for less formal queries and 38.86% in answer match scores for queries containing grammatical errors. Notably, RAG systems exhibit greater sensitivity to such variations compared to LLM-only generations, highlighting their vulnerability to error propagation due to linguistic shifts.

In our prior work, a Compliance-Aware Tactile Control and Hybrid Deformation Regulation (CATCH-FORM-3D) strategy fulfills robust and effective manipulations of 3D viscoelastic objects, which combines a contact force-driven admittance outer loop and a PDE-stabilized inner loop, achieving sub-millimeter surface deformation accuracy. However, this strategy requires fine-tuning of object-specific parameters and task-specific calibrations, to bridge this gap, a CATCH-FORM-ACTer is proposed, by enhancing CATCH-FORM-3D with a framework of Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT). An intuitive teleoperation system performs Learning from Demonstration (LfD) to build up a long-horizon sensing, decision-making and execution sequences. Unlike conventional ACT methods focused solely on trajectory planning, our approach dynamically adjusts stiffness, damping, and diffusion parameters in real time during multi-phase manipulations, effectively imitating human-like force-deformation modulation.

Previous research has already shown code to be more predictable than natural language as well as highlighted its statistical predictability at the token level: source code can be natural. More recently, the structure of code -- control flow, syntax graphs, abstract syntax trees etc. -- has been successfully used to improve the state-of-the-art on numerous tasks: code suggestion, code summarisation, method naming etc. This body of work implicitly assumes that structured representations of code are similarly statistically predictable, i.e. that a structured view of code is also natural. We consider that this view should be made explicit and propose directly studying the Structured Naturalness Hypothesis. Beyond just naming existing research that assumes this hypothesis and formulating it, we also provide evidence in the case of trees: TreeLSTM models over ASTs for some languages, such as Ruby, are competitive with $n$-gram models while handling the syntax token issue highlighted by previous research 'for free'. For other languages, such as Java or Python, we find tree models to perform worse, suggesting that downstream task improvement is uncorrelated to the language modelling task. Further, we show how such naturalness signals can be employed for near state-of-the-art results on just-in-time defect prediction while forgoing manual feature engineering work.","authors":["Profir-Petru P\\^ar\\c{t}achi","Mahito Sugiyama"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08234"}

To design an effective AI legal tool, as a first step, we explore users' needs with one specific use case: precedent search.

A partial differential equation (PDE) is proposed to model the spatiotemporal stress-strain dynamics, integrating 3D Kelvin-Voigt (stiffness-damping) and Maxwell (diffusion) effects to capture the material's viscoelastic behavior. Key mechanical parameters (stiffness, damping, diffusion coefficients) are estimated in real time via a PDE-driven observer. This observer fuses visual-tactile sensor data and experimentally validated forces to generate rich regressor signals. Then, an inner-outer loop control structure is built up. In the outer loop, the reference deformation is updated by a novel admittance control law, a proportional-derivative (PD) feedback law with contact force measurements, ensuring that the system responds adaptively to external interactions. In the inner loop, a reaction-diffusion PDE for the deformation tracking error is formulated and then exponentially stabilized by conforming the contact surface to analytical geometric configurations (i.e., defining Dirichlet boundary conditions). This dual-loop architecture enables the effective deformation regulation in dynamic contact environments. Experiments using a PaXini robotic hand demonstrate sub-millimeter deformation accuracy and stable force tracking.

Traditionally deployed in cloud datacenters, LLMs are now increasingly moving towards more accessible edge platforms to protect sensitive user data and ensure privacy preservation. The limited computational resources of individual edge devices, however, can result in excessively prolonged inference latency and overwhelmed memory usage. While existing research has explored collaborative edge computing to break the resource wall of individual devices, these solutions yet suffer from massive communication overhead and under-utilization of edge resources. Furthermore, they focus exclusively on optimizing the prefill phase, neglecting the crucial autoregressive decoding phase for generative LLMs. To address that, we propose Jupiter, a fast, scalable, and resource-efficient collaborative edge AI system for generative LLM inference. Jupiter introduces a flexible pipelined architecture as a principle and differentiates its system design according to the differentiated characteristics of the prefill and decoding phases. For prefill phase, Jupiter submits a novel intra-sequence pipeline parallelism and develops a meticulous parallelism planning strategy to maximize resource efficiency; For decoding, Jupiter devises an effective outline-based pipeline parallel decoding mechanism combined with speculative decoding, which further magnifies inference acceleration. Extensive evaluation based on realistic implementation demonstrates that Jupiter remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various edge environment setups, achieving up to 26.1x end-to-end latency reduction while rendering on-par generation quality.","authors":["Shengyuan Ye","Bei Ouyang","Liekang Zeng","Tianyi Qian","Xiaowen Chu","Jian Tang","Xu Chen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08242"}

Computing reachable sets for systems with CBF-based controllers is an effective approach for runtime performance and stability verification, and can potentially serve as a tool for trajectory re-planning. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient interval reachability method for performance verification of systems with optimization-based controllers by: (i) approximating the optimization-based controller by a pre-trained neural network to avoid solving optimization problems repeatedly, and (ii) using mixed monotone theory to construct an embedding system that leverages state-of-the-art neural network verification algorithms for bounding the output of the neural network. Results in terms of closeness of solutions of trajectories of the system with the optimization-based controller and the neural network are derived. Using a single trajectory of the embedding system along with our closeness of solutions result, we obtain an over-approximation of the reachable set of the system with optimization-based controllers.

This paper proposes Photoclinometry-from-Motion (PhoMo), a novel framework that incorporates photoclinometry techniques into a keypoint-based structure-from-motion (SfM) system to estimate the surface normal and albedo at detected landmarks to improve autonomous surface and shape characterization of small celestial bodies from in-situ imagery. In contrast to SPC, we forego the expensive maplet estimation step and instead use dense keypoint measurements and correspondences from an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep learning. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for simultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions, Sun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun vector measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is validated on real imagery taken by the Dawn mission to the asteroid 4 Vesta and the minor planet 1 Ceres and compared against an SPC reconstruction, where we demonstrate superior rendering performance compared to an SPC solution and precise alignment to a stereophotogrammetry (SPG) solution without relying on any a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop.","authors":["Travis Driver","Andrew Vaughan","Yang Cheng","Adnan Ansar","John Christian","Panagiotis Tsiotras"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08252"}

These attacks often exploit outliers, which are especially vulnerable due to their position at the boundaries of the data domain (e.g., at the minimum and maximum values). However, the role of data domain extraction in generative models and its impact on privacy attacks have been overlooked. In this paper, we examine three strategies for defining the data domain: assuming it is externally provided (ideally from public data), extracting it directly from the input data, and extracting it with DP mechanisms. While common in popular implementations and libraries, we show that the second approach breaks end-to-end DP guarantees and leaves models vulnerable. While using a provided domain (if representative) is preferable, extracting it with DP can also defend against popular MIAs, even at high privacy budgets.","authors":["Georgi Ganev","Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai","Sofiane Mahiou","Emiliano De Cristofaro"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08254"}

Existing methods for Multimodal Multi-hop Question Answering (MMQA) often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities, reliance on modality conversion, and inadequate alignment between visual and textual representations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Vision-Language Multimodal Transformer (VLMT), a unified architecture that integrates a transformer-based vision encoder with a sequence-to-sequence language model. VLMT employs a direct token-level injection mechanism to fuse visual and textual inputs within a shared embedding space, eliminating the need for intermediate projection layers. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reasoning, a three-stage pretraining strategy is proposed to progressively align vision-language representations and improve the model's capacity for multimodal understanding. Based on the pretrained backbone, two task-specific modules are instantiated to form a two-stage MMQA framework: a multimodal reranker that predicts document relevance scores and utilizes a relative threshold with top-k strategy for context retrieval, and a multimodal question answering model that generates contextually grounded answers based on the retrieved evidence. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. On MultimodalQA validation set, VLMT-Large achieves 76.5% Exact Match and 80.1% F1, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by +9.1% in Exact Match and +8.8% in F1.

However, this strength also introduces new risks, as publicly available palmprint images can be misused by adversaries for malicious activities. Despite this growing concern, research on methods to obscure or anonymize palmprints remains largely unexplored. Thus, it is essential to develop a palmprint de-identification technique capable of removing identity-revealing features while retaining the image's utility and preserving non-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse, high-quality palmprint images that conceal identity features for de-identification purposes. To ensure greater stability and controllability in the synthesis process, we incorporate a semantic-guided embedding fusion alongside a prior interpolation mechanism. We further propose the de-identification ratio, a novel metric for intuitive de-identification assessment. Extensive experiments across multiple palmprint datasets and recognition methods demonstrate that our method effectively conceals identity-related traits with significant diversity across de-identified samples. The de-identified samples preserve high visual fidelity and maintain excellent usability, achieving a balance between de-identification and retaining non-identity information.","authors":["Licheng Yan","Bob Zhang","Andrew Beng Jin Teoh","Lu Leng","Shuyi Li","Yuqi Wang","Ziyuan Yang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08272"}

However, multilingual TTS remains challenging due to discrepancies in phoneme vocabularies and variations in prosody and speaking style across languages. Existing approaches either train separate models for each language, which achieve high performance at the cost of increased computational resources, or use a unified model for multiple languages that struggles to capture fine-grained, language-specific style variations. In this work, we propose LanStyleTTS, a non-autoregressive, language-aware style adaptive TTS framework that standardizes phoneme representations and enables fine-grained, phoneme-level style control across languages. This design supports a unified multilingual TTS model capable of producing accurate and high-quality speech without the need to train language-specific models. We evaluate LanStyleTTS by integrating it with several state-of-the-art non-autoregressive TTS architectures. Results show consistent performance improvements across different model backbones. Furthermore, we investigate a range of acoustic feature representations, including mel-spectrograms and autoencoder-derived latent features. Our experiments demonstrate that latent encodings can significantly reduce model size and computational cost while preserving high-quality speech generation.","authors":["Haowei Lou","Hye-young Paik","Sheng Li","Wen Hu","Lina Yao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08274"}

However, these physics losses rely on derivatives. Computing these derivatives remains challenging, with spectral and finite difference methods introducing approximation errors due to finite resolution. Here, we propose the mollified graph neural operator (mGNO), the first method to leverage automatic differentiation and compute \\emph{exact} gradients on arbitrary geometries. This enhancement enables efficient training on irregular grids and varying geometries while allowing seamless evaluation of physics losses at randomly sampled points for improved generalization. For a PDE example on regular grids, mGNO paired with autograd reduced the L2 relative data error by 20x compared to finite differences, although training was slower. It can also solve PDEs on unstructured point clouds seamlessly, using physics losses only, at resolutions vastly lower than those needed for finite differences to be accurate enough. On these unstructured point clouds, mGNO leads to errors that are consistently 2 orders of magnitude lower than machine learning baselines (Meta-PDE) for comparable runtimes, and also delivers speedups from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the numerical solver for similar accuracy. mGNOs can also be used to solve inverse design and shape optimization problems on complex geometries.","authors":["Ryan Y.

Existing methods, including semantic graph approaches, often suffer from coarse geometric representations and lack temporal robustness against noise, dynamics, and viewpoint changes. We introduce PNE-SGAN, a Probabilistic NDT-Enhanced Semantic Graph Attention Network, to overcome these limitations. PNE-SGAN enhances semantic graphs by using Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) covariance matrices as rich, discriminative geometric node features, processed via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). Crucially, it integrates graph similarity scores into a probabilistic temporal filtering framework (modeled as an HMM/Bayes filter), incorporating uncertain odometry for motion modeling and utilizing forward-backward smoothing to effectively handle ambiguities. Evaluations on challenging KITTI sequences (00 and 08) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Average Precision of 96.2\\% and 95.1\\%, respectively. PNE-SGAN significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in difficult bidirectional loop scenarios where others falter. By synergizing detailed NDT geometry with principled probabilistic temporal reasoning, PNE-SGAN offers a highly accurate and robust solution for LiDAR LCD, enhancing SLAM reliability in complex, large-scale environments.","authors":["Xiong Li","Shulei Liu","Xingning Chen","Yisong Wu","Dong Zhu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08280"}

Unlike existing methods that directly insert objects into the background, adaptive and interactive fusion remains a challenging yet appealing task. It requires the foreground to adjust or interact with the background context, enabling more coherent integration. To address this, we propose an iterative human-in-the-loop data generation pipeline, which leverages limited initial data with diverse textual prompts to generate fusion datasets across various scenarios and interactions, including placement, holding, wearing, and style transfer. Building on this, we introduce DreamFuse, a novel approach based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model, to generate consistent and harmonious fused images with both foreground and background information. DreamFuse employs a Positional Affine mechanism to inject the size and position of the foreground into the background, enabling effective foreground-background interaction through shared attention. Furthermore, we apply Localized Direct Preference Optimization guided by human feedback to refine DreamFuse, enhancing background consistency and foreground harmony. DreamFuse achieves harmonious fusion while generalizing to text-driven attribute editing of the fused results.

First, by analyzing model performance under different memorization conditions, we uncover a counterintuitive trend: LLMs perform worse on memorized MCQs than on non-memorized ones, indicating the coexistence of two distinct learning phenomena, i.e., rote memorization and genuine capability learning. To disentangle them, we propose TrinEval, a novel evaluation framework that reformulates MCQs into an alternative trinity format, reducing memorization while preserving knowledge assessment.

Existing approaches that use VLMs for 3D Visual Grounding tasks often focus on obtaining scene information through geometric and visual information, overlooking the extraction of diverse semantic information from the scene and the understanding of rich implicit semantic attributes, such as appearance, physics, and affordance. The 3D scene graph, which combines geometry and language, is an ideal representation method for environmental perception and is an effective carrier for language models in 3D Visual Grounding tasks. To address these issues, we propose a diverse semantic map construction method specifically designed for robotic agents performing 3D Visual Grounding tasks. This method leverages VLMs to capture the latent semantic attributes and relations of objects within the scene and creates a Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) through a geometry sliding-window map construction strategy. We enhance the understanding of grounding information based on DSM and introduce a novel approach named DSM-Grounding.

However, for Large Language Models (LLMs) this task is surprisingly hard, as some properties of sorting are among known weaknesses of LLMs: being faithful to the input data, logical comparisons between values, and strictly differentiating between syntax (used for sorting) and semantics (typically learned by embeddings). Within this paper, we describe the new SortBench benchmark for LLMs that comes with different difficulties and that can be easily scaled in terms of difficulty. We apply this benchmark to seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including current test-time reasoning models. Our results show that while the o3-mini model is very capable at sorting in general, even this can be fooled if strings are defined to mix syntactical and semantical aspects, e.g., by asking to sort numbers written-out as word. Furthermore, all models have problems with the faithfulness to the input of long lists, i.e., they drop items and add new ones. Our results also show that test-time reasoning has a tendency to overthink problems which leads to performance degradation. Finally, models without test-time reasoning like GPT-4o are not much worse than reasoning models.","authors":["Steffen Herbold"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08312"}

Traditional set reconciliation schemes are either statistical, offering success probability as a function of communication overhead and symmetric difference size, or require parametrization and estimation of that size, which can be error-prone. We present CertainSync, a novel reconciliation framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to guarantee successful set reconciliation without any parametrization or estimators. The framework is rateless and adapts to the unknown symmetric difference size. Reconciliation is guaranteed whenever the communication overhead reaches a lower bound derived from the symmetric difference size and universe size. Our framework builds on recent constructions of Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs), ensuring successful element listing as long as the number of elements is bounded. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the certainty of reconciliation for multiple constructions. Our approach is validated by simulations, showing the ability to synchronize sets with efficient communication costs while maintaining guarantees compared to baseline schemes. To further reduce overhead in large universes such as blockchain networks, CertainSync is extended with a universe reduction technique. We compare and validate this extension, UniverseReduceSync, against the basic framework using real Ethereum transaction hash data. Results show a trade-off between lower communication costs and maintaining guarantees, offering a comprehensive solution for diverse reconciliation scenarios.","authors":["Tomer Keniagin","Eitan Yaakobi","Ori Rottenstreich"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08314"}

In this context, neural optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a principled methodological framework because it inherently accommodates the challenges of unpaired data induced by cell destruction during data acquisition. However, most existing OT approaches are incapable of conditioning on different treatment contexts (e.g., time, drug treatment, drug dosage, or cell type) and we still lack methods that unanimously show promising generalization performance to unseen treatments. Here, we propose the Conditional Monge Gap which learns OT maps conditionally on arbitrary covariates. We demonstrate its value in predicting single-cell perturbation responses conditional to one or multiple drugs, a drug dosage, or combinations thereof. We find that our conditional models achieve results comparable and sometimes even superior to the condition-specific state-of-the-art on scRNA-seq as well as multiplexed protein imaging data. Notably, by aggregating data across conditions we perform cross-task learning which unlocks remarkable generalization abilities to unseen drugs or drug dosages, widely outperforming other conditional models in capturing heterogeneity (i.e., higher moments) in the perturbed population. Finally, by scaling to hundreds of conditions and testing on unseen drugs, we narrow the gap between structure-based and effect-based drug representations, suggesting a promising path to the successful prediction of perturbation effects for unseen treatments.","authors":["Alice Driessen","Benedek Harsanyi","Marianna Rapsomaniki","Jannis Born"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08328"}

While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.","authors":["Hongyi Guan","Yichuan Gao","Chenlu Miao","Haoyang Wu","Hang Zhu","Mingfeng Lin","Huayue Liang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08334"}

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"All-in-Memory Stochastic Computing using ReRAM","abstract":"As the demand for efficient, low-power computing in embedded and edge devices grows, traditional computing methods are becoming less effective for handling complex tasks. Stochastic computing (SC) offers a promising alternative by approximating complex arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, using simple bitwise operations, like majority or AND, on random bit-streams. While SC operations are inherently fault-tolerant, their accuracy largely depends on the length and quality of the stochastic bit-streams (SBS). These bit-streams are typically generated by CMOS-based stochastic bit-stream generators that consume over 80% of the SC system's power and area. Current SC solutions focus on optimizing the logic gates but often neglect the high cost of moving the bit-streams between memory and processor. This work leverages the physics of emerging ReRAM devices to implement the entire SC flow in place: (1) generating low-cost true random numbers and SBSs, (2) conducting SC operations, and (3) converting SBSs back to binary. Considering the low reliability of ReRAM cells, we demonstrate how SC's robustness to errors copes with ReRAM's variability. Our evaluation shows significant improvements in throughput (1.39x, 2.16x) and energy consumption (1.15x, 2.8x) over state-of-the-art (CMOS- and ReRAM-based) solutions, respectively, with an average image quality drop of 5% across multiple SBS lengths and image processing tasks.","authors":["Jo\\~ao Paulo C. de Lima","Mehran Shoushtari Moghadam","Sercan Aygun","Jeronimo Castrillon","M.

Traditional methods require deriving a multi-phase ansatz to close the moment system of the Liouville equation, a process that is often computationally intensive and impractical. Our method offers an efficient alternative by introducing a novel two-stage neural network framework to close the $2N\\times 2N$ moment system, where $N$ represents the number of phases in the solution ansatz. In the first stage, we train neural networks to learn the mapping between higher-order moments and lower-order moments (along with their derivatives). The second stage incorporates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), where we substitute the learned higher-order moments to systematically close the system. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of both the loss functions and the neural network approximations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for one- and two-dimensional problems with various phase numbers $N$ in the multi-phase solutions.

While significant advances have been made in speech-to-gesture generation, synthesizing natural expressions and gestures remains challenging in gesture-to-video systems. In order to improve the generation effect, previous works adopted complex input and training strategies and required a large amount of data sets for pre-training, which brought inconvenience to practical applications. We propose a simple one-stage training method and a temporal inference method based on a diffusion model to synthesize realistic and continuous gesture videos without the need for additional training of temporal modules.The entire model makes use of existing pre-trained weights, and only a few thousand frames of data are needed for each character at a time to complete fine-tuning. Built upon the video generator, we introduce a new audio-to-video pipeline to synthesize co-speech videos, using 2D human skeleton as the intermediate motion representation.

The generated images often show significant errors with respect to the epipolar constraints that should be fulfilled, as given by the target pose. In this paper we address this issue by proposing a methodology to improve the geometric correctness of images generated by a diffusion model for single image NVS. We formulate a loss function based on image matching and epipolar constraints, and optimize the starting noise in a diffusion sampling process such that the generated image should both be a realistic image and fulfill geometric constraints derived from the given target pose. Our method does not require training data or fine-tuning of the diffusion models, and we show that we can apply it to multiple state-of-the-art models for single image NVS. The method is evaluated on the MegaScenes dataset and we show that geometric consistency is improved compared to the baseline models while retaining the quality of the generated images.","authors":["Josef Bengtson","David Nilsson","Fredrik Kahl"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08348"}

While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.","authors":["Ren Li","Cong Cao","Corentin Dumery","Yingxuan You","Hao Li","Pascal Fua"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08353"}

However, in federated learning, it is not trivial to know what the number of clusters can bring the best training result. Therefore, we propose to dynamically adjust the number of clusters to find the most ideal grouping results. It may reduce the number of users participating in the training to achieve the effect of reducing communication costs without affecting the model performance.

Given the high cost and inefficiency of manual evaluation, an automatic metric that aligns with human preferences is desirable. To this end, we present EvalMi-50K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for evaluating large-multimodal image generation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks, encompassing 2,100 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions, and (ii) large-scale human-preference annotations, including 100K mean-opinion scores (MOSs) and 50K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 50,400 images generated from 24 T2I models.

Given two images representing the start and end states of an object in motion, our goal is to generate and reconstruct the motion in 4D. We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions.

In this work, we introduce FocalLens, a conditional visual encoding method that produces different representations for the same image based on the context of interest, expressed flexibly through natural language. We leverage vision instruction tuning data and contrastively finetune a pretrained vision encoder to take natural language instructions as additional inputs for producing conditional image representations. Extensive experiments validate that conditional image representation from FocalLens better pronounce the visual features of interest compared to generic features produced by standard vision encoders like CLIP.

Traditionally, an event log is defined as a multiset of traces, where each trace is a sequence of events. The total order of the events in a sequential trace is typically based on their temporal occurrence. However, real-life processes are partially ordered by nature. Different activities can occur in different parts of the process and, thus, independently of each other. Therefore, the temporal total order of events does not necessarily reflect their causal order, as also causally unrelated events may be ordered in time. Only partial orders allow to express concurrency, duration, overlap, and uncertainty of events. Consequently, there is a growing need for process mining algorithms that can directly handle partially ordered input. In this paper, we combine two well-established and efficient algorithms, the eST Miner from the process mining community and the Firing LPO algorithm from the Petri net community, to introduce the eST$^2$ Miner. The eST$^2$ Miner is a process discovery algorithm that can directly handle partially ordered input, gives strong formal guarantees, offers good runtime and excellent space complexity, and can, thus, be used in real-life applications.","authors":["Sabine Folz-Weinstein","Christian Rennert","Lisa Luise Mannel","Robin Bergenthum","Wil van der Aalst"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08372"}

The focus is on strongly convection-dominated problems without zeroth-order reaction terms, which leads to the absence of positive L^2-like components. An important specific example is the energy/temperature equation of the Boussinesq system arising from the modelling of mantle convection of the Earth. The key mathematical challenge of mitigating the effects of exponential factors with respect to the final time, arising from the use of Gronwall-type arguments, is addressed by an exponential fitting technique. The latter results to a new class of aposteriori error estimates for the stationary problem, which are valid in cases of convection and reaction coefficient combinations not covered by the existing literature. This new class of estimators is combined with an elliptic reconstruction technique to derive new respective estimates for the non-stationary problem, exhibiting reduced dependence on Gronwall-type exponents and, thus, offer more accurate estimation for longer time intervals. We showcase the superior performance of the new class of aposteriori error estimators in driving mesh adaptivity in Earth's mantle convection simulations, in a setting where the energy/temperature equation is discretised by the discontinuous Galerkin method, coupled with the Taylor-Hood finite element for the momentum and mass conservation equations.

However, high-dimensional language model embeddings, often in the range of hundreds to thousands of dimensions, can present scalability challenges in terms of storage and latency, especially when processing massive financial text corpora. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce embedding dimensionality, thereby mitigating computational bottlenecks without incurring large accuracy losses. We experiment with a real-world dataset and compare different similarity and distance metrics under both full-dimensional and PCA-compressed embeddings. Our results show that reducing vectors from 3,072 to 110 dimensions provides a sizeable (up to $60\\times$) speedup in retrieval operations and a $\\sim 28.6\\times$ reduction in index size, with only moderate declines in correlation metrics relative to human-annotated similarity scores.

MineWorld is driven by a visual-action autoregressive Transformer, which takes paired game scenes and corresponding actions as input, and generates consequent new scenes following the actions. Specifically, by transforming visual game scenes and actions into discrete token ids with an image tokenizer and an action tokenizer correspondingly, we consist the model input with the concatenation of the two kinds of ids interleaved. The model is then trained with next token prediction to learn rich representations of game states as well as the conditions between states and actions simultaneously. In inference, we develop a novel parallel decoding algorithm that predicts the spatial redundant tokens in each frame at the same time, letting models in different scales generate $4$ to $7$ frames per second and enabling real-time interactions with game players. In evaluation, we propose new metrics to assess not only visual quality but also the action following capacity when generating new scenes, which is crucial for a world model. Our comprehensive evaluation shows the efficacy of MineWorld, outperforming SoTA open-sourced diffusion based world models significantly. The code and model have been released.","authors":["Junliang Guo","Yang Ye","Tianyu He","Haoyu Wu","Yushu Jiang","Tim Pearce","Jiang Bian"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08388"}

To address these limitations, this paper introduces Light-YOLOv8-Flame, a lightweight flame detection algorithm specifically designed for fast and efficient real-time deployment. The proposed model enhances the YOLOv8 architecture through the substitution of the original C2f module with the FasterNet Block module. This new block combines Partial Convolution (PConv) and Convolution (Conv) layers, reducing both computational complexity and model size. A dataset comprising 7,431 images, representing both flame and non-flame scenarios, was collected and augmented for training purposes. Experimental findings indicate that the modified YOLOv8 model achieves a 0.78% gain in mean average precision (mAP) and a 2.05% boost in recall, while reducing the parameter count by 25.34%, with only a marginal decrease in precision by 0.82%. These findings highlight that Light-YOLOv8-Flame offers enhanced detection performance and speed, making it well-suited for real-time fire detection on resource-constrained devices.","authors":["Jiawei Lan","Zhibiao Wang","Haoyang Yu","Ye Tao","Wenhua Cui"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08389"}

To ease collaborative home tasks by improving domestic robot speech and behaviours for human-robot communication, we designed a study to understand how people communicated when failure occurs. To identify patterns of natural communication, particularly in response to robotic failures, participants instructed Laundrobot to move laundry into baskets using natural language and gestures. Laundrobot either worked error-free, or in one of two error modes. Participants were not advised Laundrobot would be a human actor, nor given information about error modes. Video analysis from 42 participants found speech patterns, included laughter, verbal expressions, and filler words, such as ``oh'' and ``ok'', also, sequences of body movements, including touching one's own face, increased pointing with a static finger, and expressions of surprise. Common strategies deployed when errors occurred, included correcting and teaching, taking responsibility, and displays of frustration. The strength of reaction to errors diminished with exposure, possibly indicating acceptance or resignation. Some used strategies similar to those used to communicate with other technologies, such as smart assistants. An anthropomorphic robot may not be ideally suited to this kind of task. Laundrobot's appearance, morphology, voice, capabilities, and recovery strategies may have impacted how it was perceived. Some participants indicated Laundrobot's actual skills were not aligned with expectations; this made it difficult to know what to expect and how much Laundrobot understood. Expertise, personality, and cultural differences may affect responses, however these were not assessed.","authors":["Pepita Barnard","Maria J Galvez Trigo","Dominic Price","Sue Cobb","Gisela Reyes-Cruz","Gustavo Berumen","David Branson III","Mojtaba A.

However, DiT inferencing is notoriously compute-intensive and incurs long latency even on datacenter-scale GPUs, primarily due to its iterative nature and heavy reliance on GEMM operations inherent to its encoder-based structure. To address the challenge, prior work has explored quantization, but achieving low-precision quantization for DiT inferencing with both high accuracy and substantial speedup remains an open problem. To this end, this paper proposes MixDiT, an algorithm-hardware co-designed acceleration solution that exploits mixed Microscaling (MX) formats to quantize DiT activation values. MixDiT quantizes the DiT activation tensors by selectively applying higher precision to magnitude-based outliers, which produce mixed-precision GEMM operations. To achieve tangible speedup from the mixed-precision arithmetic, we design a MixDiT accelerator that enables precision-flexible multiplications and efficient MX precision conversions. Our experimental results show that MixDiT delivers a speedup of 2.10-5.32 times over RTX 3090, with no loss in FID.","authors":["Daeun Kim","Jinwoo Hwang","Changhun Oh","Jongse Park"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08398"}

However, traditional personality assessments based on self-report questionnaires may fail to capture their true behavioral nuances due to inherent biases and meta-knowledge contamination. This paper introduces a novel multi-observer framework for LLM personality assessment that draws inspiration from informant-report methods in psychology. Instead of relying solely on self-assessments, our approach employs multiple observer agents configured with a specific relationship context (e.g., family, friend, or workplace) to simulate interactive scenarios with a subject LLM. These observers engage in dialogues and subsequently provide ratings across the Big Five personality dimensions. Our experiments reveal that LLMs possess systematic biases in self-report personality ratings. Moreover, aggregating observer ratings effectively reduces non-systematic biases and achieves optimal reliability with 5-7 observers. The findings highlight the significant impact of relationship context on personality perception and demonstrate that a multi-observer paradigm yields a more robust and context-sensitive evaluation of LLM personality traits.","authors":["Yin Jou Huang","Rafik Hadfi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08399"}

Recently, Tang et al. proposed CaseLink, a novel graph-based method for legal case retrieval, which models both cases and legal charges as nodes in a network, with edges representing relationships such as references and shared semantics. This approach offers a new perspective on the task by capturing higher-order relationships of cases going beyond the stand-alone level of documents. However, while this shift in approaching legal case retrieval is a promising direction in an understudied area of graph-based legal IR, challenges in reproducing novel results have recently been highlighted, with multiple studies reporting difficulties in reproducing previous findings. Thus, in this work we reproduce CaseLink, a graph-based legal case retrieval method, to support future research in this area of IR. In particular, we aim to assess its reliability and generalizability by (i) first reproducing the original study setup and (ii) applying the approach to an additional dataset. We then build upon the original implementations by (iii) evaluating the approach's performance when using a more sophisticated graph data representation and (iv) using an open large language model (LLM) in the pipeline to address limitations that are known to result from using closed models accessed via an API. Our findings aim to improve the understanding of graph-based approaches in legal IR and contribute to improving reproducibility in the field.

For many CO problems, the pricing problem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). Large ESPPRC instances are difficult to solve to near-optimality. Consequently, we use a Graph neural Network (GNN) to reduces the size of the ESPPRC such that it becomes computationally tractable with standard solving techniques. Our GNN is trained by Unsupervised Learning and outputs a distribution for the arcs to be retained in the reduced PP. The reduced PP is solved by a local search that finds columns with large reduced costs and speeds up convergence. We apply our method on a set of Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows and show significant improvements in convergence compared to simple reduction techniques from the literature.

The severity is so high that researchers across the globe are captivated by this domain. A notable amount of work has been conducted to address the identification and alarm system. However, a noticeable gap exists, especially for low-resource languages. Comprehensive datasets are the main problem among the constrained resource languages, such as Bangla. Interestingly, hate speech or any particular speech has no single dimensionality. Similarly, the hate component can simultaneously have multiple abusive attributes, which seems to be missed in the existing datasets. Thus, a multi-label Bangla hate speech dataset named BOISHOMMO has been compiled and evaluated in this work. That includes categories of HS across race, gender, religion, politics, and more. With over two thousand annotated examples, BOISHOMMO provides a nuanced understanding of hate speech in Bangla and highlights the complexities of processing non-Latin scripts. Apart from evaluating with multiple algorithmic approaches, it also highlights the complexities of processing Bangla text and assesses model performance.

To alleviate these issues, adversarial noise-based defenses have been enthusiastically studied in recent years. However, ``data-only\" methods tend to distort fake samples in the low-level feature space rather than the high-level semantic space, leading to limitations in resisting malicious manipulation. Frontier research has shown that integrating knowledge in deep learning can produce reliable and generalizable solutions. Inspired by these, we propose a knowledge-guided adversarial defense (KGAD) to actively force malicious manipulation models to output semantically confusing samples. Specifically, in the process of generating adversarial noise, we focus on constructing significant semantic confusions at the domain-specific knowledge level, and exploit a metric closely related to visual perception to replace the general pixel-wise metrics. The generated adversarial noise can actively interfere with the malicious manipulation model by triggering knowledge-guided and perception-related disruptions in the fake samples. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on human perception and visual quality assessment. The results on two different tasks both show that our defense provides better protection compared to state-of-the-art methods and achieves great generalizability.","authors":["Dawei Zhou","Suzhi Gang","Decheng Liu","Tongliang Liu","Nannan Wang","Xinbo Gao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08411"}

For exemplar-free incremental learning, the pre-trained model methods have achieved state-of-the-art results in 2D domains. However, these methods cannot be migrated to the 3D domains due to the limited pre-training datasets and insufficient focus on fine-grained geometric details. This paper breaks through these limitations, proposing a basic shape dataset with zero collection cost for model pre-training. It helps a model obtain extensive knowledge of 3D geometries. Based on this, we propose a framework embedded with 3D geometry knowledge for incremental learning in point clouds, compatible with exemplar-free (-based) settings. In the incremental stage, the geometry knowledge is extended to represent objects in point clouds. The class prototype is calculated by regularizing the data representation with the same category and is kept adjusting in the learning process. It helps the model remember the shape features of different categories. Experiments show that our method outperforms other baseline methods by a large margin on various benchmark datasets, considering both exemplar-free (-based) settings.","authors":["Chao Qi","Jianqin Yin","Meng Chen","Yingchun Niu","Yuan Sun"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08412"}

Our goal is to mathematically analyze the influence of biased media, arising from factors such as manipulated news reporting or the phenomenon of false balance. Within our framework, we examine the scenario of two opposing media sources, which do not adapt their opinions like ordinary nodes, and analyze the conditions and the number of periods required for radicalizing the opinions in the network. When both media sources possess equal influence, we theoretically characterize the final opinion configuration. In the special case where there is only a single media source present, we prove that media sources which do not adapt their opinions are significantly more powerful than those which do. Lastly, we conduct the experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, showing that our theoretical guarantees closely align with experimental simulations.","authors":["Charlotte Out","Sijing Tu","Stefan Neumann","Ahad N.

These challenges are exacerbated in multi-agent settings, where agents learn simultaneously and influence the underlying state as well as each others' observations. We propose the use of learned beliefs on the underlying state of the system to overcome these challenges and enable reinforcement learning with fully decentralized training and execution. Our approach leverages state information to pre-train a probabilistic belief model in a self-supervised fashion. The resulting belief states, which capture both inferred state information as well as uncertainty over this information, are then used in a state-based reinforcement learning algorithm to create an end-to-end model for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning under partial observability. By separating the belief and reinforcement learning tasks, we are able to significantly simplify the policy and value function learning tasks and improve both the convergence speed and the final performance.

However, establishing correlations between mechanical characteristics and repeat sequences is challenging due to the intricate sequence-structure-function relationships of MaSps and the limited availability of annotated datasets. In this study, we present a novel computational framework for designing MaSp repeat sequences with customizable mechanical properties.

Machine learning approaches accelerate this process by leveraging biological knowledge represented in ontologies and the structure of knowledge graphs. Still, many existing works overlook ontologies explicitly representing diseases, missing causal and semantic relationships between them. The gene-disease association problem naturally frames itself as a link prediction task, where embedding algorithms directly predict associations by exploring the structure and properties of the knowledge graph. Some works frame it as a node-pair classification task, combining embedding algorithms with traditional machine learning algorithms. This strategy aligns with the logic of a machine learning pipeline. However, the use of negative examples and the lack of validated gene-disease associations to train embedding models may constrain its effectiveness. This work introduces a novel framework for comparing the performance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks, analyses the performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches, and compares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association prediction. It also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a disease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies. The framework involves five steps: data splitting, knowledge graph integration, embedding, modeling and prediction, and method evaluation. Results show that enriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves performance, while additional links generate a greater impact. Link prediction methods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs. Although node-pair classification methods identify all true positives, link prediction methods outperform overall.","authors":["Catarina Canastra","C\\'atia Pesquita"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08445"}

This paper introduces a robust, quantitative methodology grounded in Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to measure distributional differences between generative processes. By comparing entire output distributions rather than conducting pairwise similarity checks, our approach directly contrasts creative processes--overcoming the computational challenges inherent in evaluating AI outputs against unbounded prior art corpora. Through experiments combining kernel mean embeddings with domain-specific machine learning representations (LeNet-5 for MNIST digits, CLIP for art), we demonstrate exceptional sensitivity: our method distinguishes MNIST digit classes with 95% confidence using just 5-6 samples and differentiates AI-generated art from human art in the AI-ArtBench dataset (n=400 per category; p<0.0001) using as few as 7-10 samples per distribution despite human evaluators' limited discrimination ability (58% accuracy). These findings challenge the \"stochastic parrot\" hypothesis by providing empirical evidence that AI systems produce outputs from semantically distinct distributions rather than merely replicating training data. Our approach bridges technical capabilities with legal doctrine, offering a pathway to modernize originality assessments while preserving intellectual property law's core objectives. This research provides courts and policymakers with a computationally efficient, legally relevant tool to quantify AI novelty--a critical advancement as AI blurs traditional authorship and inventorship boundaries.","authors":["Anirban Mukherjee","Hannah Hanwen Chang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08446"}

These devices provide diverse, multi-modal sensor inputs, including egocentric images, and 1-3 sparse IMU sensors in varied combinations. Motion descriptions can also accompany these signals. The diverse input modalities and their intermittent availability pose challenges for consistent motion capture and understanding. In this work, we present Ego4o (o for omni), a new framework for simultaneous human motion capture and understanding from multi-modal egocentric inputs. This method maintains performance with partial inputs while achieving better results when multiple modalities are combined. First, the IMU sensor inputs, the optional egocentric image, and text description of human motion are encoded into the latent space of a motion VQ-VAE. Next, the latent vectors are sent to the VQ-VAE decoder and optimized to track human motion. When motion descriptions are unavailable, the latent vectors can be input into a multi-modal LLM to generate human motion descriptions, which can further enhance motion capture accuracy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in predicting accurate human motion and high-quality motion descriptions.","authors":["Jian Wang","Rishabh Dabral","Diogo Luvizon","Zhe Cao","Lingjie Liu","Thabo Beeler","Christian Theobalt"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08449"}

However, real-time deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to computational and memory constraints. We propose Muon-AD, a co-designed framework that integrates the Muon optimizer with attention distillation for real-time edge synthesis. By eliminating gradient conflicts through orthogonal parameter updates and dynamic pruning, Muon-AD achieves 3.2 times faster convergence compared to Stable Diffusion-TensorRT, while maintaining synthesis quality (15% lower FID, 4% higher SSIM). Our framework reduces peak memory to 7GB on Jetson Orin and enables 24FPS real-time generation through mixed-precision quantization and curriculum learning. Extensive experiments on COCO-Stuff and ImageNet-Texture demonstrate Muon-AD's Pareto-optimal efficiency-quality trade-offs. Here, we show a 65% reduction in communication overhead during distributed training and real-time 10s/image generation on edge GPUs.

As the volume of user-item interactions grows exponentially, especially in Big Data environments, selecting the most appropriate RS model becomes a critical task. This paper presents a comparative study of several state-of-the-art recommender algorithms, including EASE-R, SLIM, SLIM with ElasticNet regularization, Matrix Factorization (FunkSVD and ALS), P3Alpha, and RP3Beta. We evaluate these models according to key criteria such as scalability, computational complexity, predictive accuracy, and interpretability. The analysis considers both their theoretical underpinnings and practical applicability in large-scale scenarios. Our results highlight that while models like SLIM and SLIM-ElasticNet offer high accuracy and interpretability, they suffer from high computational costs, making them less suitable for real-time applications. In contrast, algorithms such as EASE-R and RP3Beta achieve a favorable balance between performance and scalability, proving more effective in large-scale environments.

In particular, we consider 2nfas with common-guess (2nfas+cg), which are 2nfas equipped with a new kind of nondeterminism that allows the device to initially annotate each input symbol, before performing a read-only computation over the resulting annotated word. Their deterministic counterparts, namely two-way deterministic finite automata with common-guess (2dfas+cg), still have a nondeterministic annotation phase and can be considered as a restriction of 1-las. We prove exponential lower bounds for the simulations of 2dfas+cg (and thus of 1-las) by deterministic 1-las and by 2nfas. These results are derived from a doubly exponential lower bound for the simulation of 2dfas+cg by one-way deterministic finite automata (1dfas). Our lower bounds are witnessed by unary languages, namely languages defined over a singleton alphabet. As a consequence, we close a question left open in [Pighizzini and Prigioniero.

Although most state-of-the-art NSCs are trained as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models (DMs), a recent class of generative models, represent a promising alternative due to their superior performance in image generation relative to GANs. Consequently, DMs have been successfully applied for audio and speech coding among various other audio generation applications. However, the design of diffusion-based NSCs has not yet been explored in a systematic way. We address this by providing a comprehensive analysis of diffusion-based NSCs divided into three contributions. First, we propose a categorization based on the conditioning and output domains of the DM. This simple conceptual framework allows us to define a design space for diffusion-based NSCs and to assign a category to existing approaches in the literature. Second, we systematically investigate unexplored designs by creating and evaluating new diffusion-based NSCs within the conceptual framework. Finally, we compare the proposed models to existing GAN and DM baselines through objective metrics and subjective listening tests.","authors":["Pietro Foti","Andreas Brendel"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08470"}

We have developed a synthetic data pipeline for generating high-quality context-aware instance segmentation training data for specific objects. This process is fully automated, requiring only a video of the target object. We train a Gaussian Splatting model of the target object and automatically extract the object from the video. Leveraging Gaussian Splatting, we then render the object on a random background image, and monocular depth estimation is employed to place the object in a believable pose.

These attacks exploit common vulnerabilities in machine learning models to bypass security measures and compromise systems. Although the transferability concept has been widely studied, its practical feasibility remains limited due to assumptions of high similarity between source and target models. This paper analyzes the core factors that contribute to transferability, including feature alignment, model architectural similarity, and overlap in the data distributions that each IDS examines. We propose a novel metric, the Transferability Feasibility Score (TFS), to assess the feasibility and reliability of such attacks based on these factors. Through experimental evidence, we demonstrate that TFS and actual attack success rates are highly correlated, addressing the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world impact. Our findings provide needed guidance for designing more realistic transferable adversarial attacks, developing robust defenses, and ultimately improving the security of machine learning-based IDS in critical systems.","authors":["Sabrine Ennaji","Elhadj Benkhelifa","Luigi Vincenzo Mancini"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08480"}

More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid CNN-ViT models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for medical image classification. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the model's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical image classification tasks using color fundus images.

A widespread approach is using services implemented with Web technologies like REST or OpenAPI, which offer an interaction mechanism and service documentation standard, respectively. Each service represents a specific business functionality, allowing encapsulation and easier maintenance. Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual service level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated service composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice due to their reliance on complex formal modeling. Within this Ph.D. thesis, we analyze the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically integrate the services based on a natural language input. The result is a reusable service composition, e.g., as program code. While not always generating entirely correct results, the result can still be helpful by providing integration engineers with a close approximation of a suitable solution, which requires little effort to become operational. Our research involves (i) introducing a software architecture for automated service composition using LLMs, (ii) analyzing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for service discovery, (iii) proposing a novel natural language query-based benchmark for service discovery, and (iv) extending the benchmark to complete service composition scenarios. We have presented our software architecture as Compositio Prompto, the analysis of RAG for service discovery, and submitted a proposal for the service discovery benchmark.

We introduce a prompt synthesis method that dynamically generates LLM prompts based on the active node path, significantly improving execution consistency and contextual grounding.

But these models produce distinctive errors known as hallucinations - outputs that are incorrect yet superficially plausible. Worse, some arguments suggest that hallucinations are an inevitable consequence of the mechanisms underlying generative inference. Fortunately, such arguments rely on a conception of hallucination defined solely with respect to internal properties of the model, rather than in reference to the empirical target system. This conception fails to distinguish epistemically benign errors from those that threaten scientific inference. I introduce the concept of corrosive hallucination to capture the epistemically troubling subclass: misrepresentations that are substantively misleading and resistant to systematic anticipation. I argue that although corrosive hallucinations do pose a threat to scientific reliability, they are not inevitable. Scientific workflows such as those surrounding AlphaFold and GenCast, both of which serve as case studies, can neutralize their effects by imposing theoretical constraints during training, and by strategically screening for errors at inference time. When embedded in such workflows, generative AI can reliably contribute to scientific knowledge.","authors":["Charles Rathkopf"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08526"}

In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have attracted significant attention in text classification tasks. However, although they demonstrate excellent performance on large-scale short-text datasets, their effectiveness remains under-explored for small samples, particularly in AA tasks. Additionally, a key challenge is how to effectively leverage PLMs in conjunction with traditional feature-based methods to advance AA research. In this study, we aimed to significantly improve performance using an integrated integrative ensemble of traditional feature-based and modern PLM-based methods on an AA task in a small sample. For the experiment, we used two corpora of literary works to classify 10 authors each. The results indicate that BERT is effective, even for small-sample AA tasks. Both BERT-based and classifier ensembles outperformed their respective stand-alone models, and the integrated ensemble approach further improved the scores significantly. For the corpus that was not included in the pre-training data, the integrated ensemble improved the F1 score by approximately 14 points, compared to the best-performing single model.

We propose a three-phase framework to fine-tune existing captioning models that enhances caption accuracy and consistency across views via a consensus mechanism. First, an agent explores the environment, collecting noisy image-caption pairs. Then, a consistent pseudo-caption for each object instance is distilled via consensus using a large language model. Finally, these pseudo-captions are used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf captioning model, with the addition of contrastive learning. We analyse the performance of the combination of captioning models, exploration policies, pseudo-labeling methods, and fine-tuning strategies, on our manually labeled test set. Results show that a policy can be trained to mine samples with higher disagreement compared to classical baselines. Our pseudo-captioning method, in combination with all policies, has a higher semantic similarity compared to other existing methods, and fine-tuning improves caption accuracy and consistency by a significant margin.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Genetic Algorithm Design Exploration for On-Device Training on FPGAs","abstract":"We propose an automated Design Space Exploration (DSE) workflow for generating adaptive and reconfigurable deep learning models on FPGA hardware. The workflow consists of two main components: Offline Design Exploration (ODE) and Online Design Reconfiguration (ODR). ODE applies a multi-objective genetic algorithm to explore CNN-based hardware configurations, optimizing for latency and resource utilization by leveraging intra-layer parallelism. Given a CNN architecture and user-defined constraints, the hardware model is generated automatically. ODR enables runtime hardware adaptability by dynamically selecting between partial or full reconfigurable designs based on application requirements. This flexibility is essential for time-critical, autonomous onboard systems. We demonstrate the proposed workflow on the Xilinx Zynq-7100 FPGA operating at 200 MHz, using CNN models trained on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10. ODE-generated designs show latency improvements of up to 95 times for MNIST, 71 times for CIFAR-10, and 18 times for SVHN. Resource utilization in DSP slices was improved by up to 44 times for MNIST, 52 times for SVHN, and 24 times for CIFAR-10. The ODR approach achieved trade-offs between accuracy and performance, such as a 0.7 percent accuracy drop for a 13 times speedup and 25 percent power reduction on MNIST, a 2 percent drop for 14 times speedup and 28 percent power savings on SVHN, and a 4 percent drop for 50 times speedup with 32.5 percent power reduction on CIFAR-10.","authors":["Alaa Mazouz","Van-Tam Nguyen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08534"}

We aim to keep the states of the system within a given safe set under potential actuator and sensor attacks. Specifically, we adopt the setup that a controller has already been designed to stabilize the plant. Using invariant sets and barrier certificate theory, we first give sufficient conditions to verify the safety of the closed-loop system under attacks. Furthermore, by using a subset of sensors that are assumed to be free of attacks, we provide a synthesis method for a secondary controller that enhances the safety of the system. The sufficient conditions to verify safety are derived using Lyapunov-based tools and the S-procedure. Using the projection lemma, the conditions are then formulated as linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems which can be solved efficiently.

However, optimizing learning at the network edge entails unique challenges, particularly when moving beyond conventional settings and objectives. While Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for distributed model training, critical challenges persist. First, existing approaches often overlook the trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability. Second, they struggle to integrate inherently explainable models such as decision trees because their non-differentiable structure makes them not amenable to backpropagation-based training algorithms. Lastly, they lack meaningful mechanisms for continual Machine Learning (ML) model adaptation through Continual Learning (CL) in resource-limited environments. In this paper, we pave the way for a set of novel optimization problems that emerge in distributed learning at the network edge with wirelessly interconnected edge devices, and we identify key challenges and future directions. Specifically, we discuss how Multi-objective optimization (MOO) can be used to address the trade-off between predictive accuracy and explainability when using complex predictive models. Next, we discuss the implications of integrating inherently explainable tree-based models into distributed learning settings. Finally, we investigate how CL strategies can be effectively combined with FL to support adaptive, lifelong learning when limited-size buffers are used to store past data for retraining. Our approach offers a cohesive set of tools for designing privacy-preserving, adaptive, and trustworthy ML solutions tailored to the demands of edge computing and intelligent services.","authors":["Thomas Tsouparopoulos","Iordanis Koutsopoulos"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08536"}

While prior work suggested lexical bundles (LBs) - recurrent multi-word sequences satisfying certain frequency criteria - could inform assessment, their empirical integration into AS models needs further investigation. This study tested the impact of incorporating LB frequency features into an AS model for TOEFL independent writing tasks. Analyzing a sampled subcorpus (N=1,225 essays, 9 L1s) from the TOEFL11 corpus, scored by ETS-trained raters (Low, Medium, High), 3- to 9-word LBs were extracted, distinguishing prompt-specific from non-prompt types. A baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) scoring model using established linguistic features (e.g., mechanics, cohesion, sophistication) was compared against an extended model including three aggregate LB frequency features (total prompt, total non-prompt, overall total). Results revealed significant, though generally small-effect, relationships between LB frequency (especially non-prompt bundles) and proficiency (p < .05). Mean frequencies suggested lower proficiency essays used more LBs overall. Critically, the LB-enhanced model improved agreement with human raters (Quadratic Cohen's Kappa +2.05%, overall Cohen's Kappa +5.63%), with notable gains for low (+10.1% exact agreement) and medium (+14.3% Cohen's Kappa) proficiency essays. These findings demonstrate that integrating aggregate LB frequency offers potential for developing more linguistically informed and accurate AS systems, particularly for differentiating developing L2 writers.","authors":["Burak Senel"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08537"}

A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed, virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object, accurately capturing its shape, appearance, physical properties, and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of a large-scale, digital twin quality real-world dataset and benchmark that can quantitatively assess and compare the performance of different reconstruction methods, as well as improve reconstruction quality through training or fine-tuning. Moreover, to democratize 3D digital twin creation, it is essential to integrate creation techniques with next-generation egocentric computing platforms, such as AR glasses. Currently, there is no dataset available to evaluate 3D object reconstruction using egocentric captured images. To address these gaps, the DTC dataset features 2,000 scanned digital twin-quality 3D objects, along with image sequences captured under different lighting conditions using DSLR cameras and egocentric AR glasses. This dataset establishes the first comprehensive real-world evaluation benchmark for 3D digital twin creation tasks, offering a robust foundation for comparing and improving existing reconstruction methods.

However, applying DPO to video diffusion models faces critical challenges: (1) Data inefficiency. Generating thousands of videos per DPO iteration incurs prohibitive costs; (2) Evaluation uncertainty. Human annotations suffer from subjective bias, and automated discriminators fail to detect subtle temporal artifacts like flickering or motion incoherence. To address these, we propose a discriminator-free video DPO framework that: (1) Uses original real videos as win cases and their edited versions (e.g., reversed, shuffled, or noise-corrupted clips) as lose cases; (2) Trains video diffusion models to distinguish and avoid artifacts introduced by editing. This approach eliminates the need for costly synthetic video comparisons, provides unambiguous quality signals, and enables unlimited training data expansion through simple editing operations. We theoretically prove the framework's effectiveness even when real videos and model-generated videos follow different distributions.

While significant progress has been made in high-resource languages, emotion detection in low-resource languages remains underexplored. In this work, we address multilingual and cross-lingual emotion detection by leveraging adapter-based fine-tuning with multilingual pre-trained language models. Adapters introduce a small number of trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained model weights fixed, offering a parameter-efficient approach to adaptation. We experiment with different adapter tuning strategies, including task-only adapters, target-language-ready task adapters, and language-family-based adapters. Our results show that target-language-ready task adapters achieve the best overall performance, particularly for low-resource African languages with our team ranking 7th for Tigrinya, and 8th for Kinyarwanda in Track A. In Track C, our system ranked 3rd for Amharic, and 4th for Oromo, Tigrinya, Kinyarwanda, Hausa, and Igbo.

A key challenge in working with GMMs is defining a computationally efficient and geometrically meaningful metric. The mixture Wasserstein (MW) distance adapts the Wasserstein metric to GMMs and has been applied in various domains, including domain adaptation, dataset comparison, and reinforcement learning. However, its high computational cost -- arising from repeated Wasserstein distance computations involving matrix square root estimations and an expensive linear program -- limits its scalability to high-dimensional and large-scale problems. To address this, we propose multiple novel slicing-based approximations to the MW distance that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving key optimal transport properties. From a theoretical viewpoint, we establish several weak and strong equivalences between the introduced metrics, and show the relations to the original MW distance and the well-established sliced Wasserstein distance.

What sets COP-GEN-Beta apart is its ability to map any subset of modalities to any other, enabling zero-shot modality translation after training.

A key component in addressing this challenge is the model's ability to separate novel samples, where Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has been effectively employed. In this work, we propose a novel method that integrates EVT with proxy anchors to define boundaries around proxies using a probability of inclusion function, enabling the rejection of unknown samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel EVT-based loss function to enhance the learned representation, achieving superior performance compared to other deep-metric learning methods in similar settings. Using the derived probability functions, novel samples are effectively separated from previously known categories. However, category discovery within these novel samples can sometimes overestimate the number of new categories. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel EVT-based approach to reduce the model size and discard redundant proxies. We also incorporate experience replay and knowledge distillation mechanisms during the continual learning stage to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in continual generalized category discovery scenarios.","authors":["Alireza Fathalizadeh","Roozbeh Razavi-Far"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08550"}

However, including additional modalities may improve the robustness of the approaches to common issues in egocentric videos, such as blurriness and occlusions. Recent efforts in multimodal egocentric action recognition often assume the availability of all modalities, leading to failures or performance drops when any modality is missing. To address this, we introduce an efficient multimodal knowledge distillation approach for egocentric action recognition that is robust to missing modalities (KARMMA) while still benefiting when multiple modalities are available. Our method focuses on resource-efficient development by leveraging pre-trained models as unimodal feature extractors in our teacher model, which distills knowledge into a much smaller and faster student model.

In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language.

Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and privacy-preserving approach to training but struggles in highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where institutions with more representative data may experience degraded performance. Moreover, existing large-scale FL studies have been limited to adult datasets, neglecting the unique challenges posed by pediatric data, which introduces additional non-IID variability. To address these limitations, we analyzed n=398,523 adult chest radiographs from diverse institutions across multiple countries and n=9,125 pediatric images, leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose self-supervised image representations to classify pneumonia and cases with no abnormality. Using state-of-the-art vision transformers, we found that FL improved performance only for smaller adult datasets (P<0.001) but degraded performance for larger datasets (P<0.064) and pediatric cases (P=0.242). However, equipping FL with self-supervised weights significantly enhanced outcomes across pediatric cases (P=0.031) and most adult datasets (P<0.008), except the largest dataset (P=0.052). These findings underscore the potential of easily deployable general-purpose self-supervised image representations to address non-IID challenges in clinical FL applications and highlight their promise for enhancing patient outcomes and advancing pediatric healthcare, where data scarcity and variability remain persistent obstacles.","authors":["Mahshad Lotfinia","Arash Tayebiarasteh","Samaneh Samiei","Mehdi Joodaki","Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08584"}

On-Demand Delivery Using Fleets of Drones with Unknown, Heterogeneous Energy Storage Constraints","abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expected to transform logistics, reducing delivery time, costs, and emissions. This study addresses an on-demand delivery , in which fleets of UAVs are deployed to fulfil orders that arrive stochastically. Unlike previous work, it considers UAVs with heterogeneous, unknown energy storage capacities and assumes no knowledge of the energy consumption models. We propose a decentralised deployment strategy that combines auction-based task allocation with online learning. Each UAV independently decides whether to bid for orders based on its energy storage charge level, the parcel mass, and delivery distance. Over time, it refines its policy to bid only for orders within its capability. Simulations using realistic UAV energy models reveal that, counter-intuitively, assigning orders to the least confident bidders reduces delivery times and increases the number of successfully fulfilled orders. This strategy is shown to outperform threshold-based methods which require UAVs to exceed specific charge levels at deployment. We propose a variant of the strategy which uses learned policies for forecasting. This enables UAVs with insufficient charge levels to commit to fulfilling orders at specific future times, helping to prioritise early orders.

Predicting the next word in an existing text has turned out to be a powerful signal, at least at scale. But there are signs that we are running out of this resource. In recent months, interaction between learner and feedback-giver has come into focus, both for \"alignment\" (with a reward model judging the quality of instruction following attempts) and for improving \"reasoning\" (process- and outcome-based verifiers judging reasoning steps). In this paper, we explore to what extent synthetic interaction in what we call Dialogue Games -- goal-directed and rule-governed activities driven predominantly by verbal actions -- can provide a learning signal, and how this signal can be used. We introduce an environment for producing such interaction data (with the help of a Large Language Model as counterpart to the learner model), both offline and online. We investigate the effects of supervised fine-tuning on this data, as well as reinforcement learning setups such as DPO, and GRPO; showing that all of these approaches achieve some improvements in in-domain games, but only GRPO demonstrates the ability to generalise to out-of-domain games as well as retain competitive performance in reference-based tasks. We release the framework and the baseline training setups in the hope that this can foster research in this promising new direction.","authors":["Nicola Horst","Davide Mazzaccara","Antonia Schmidt","Michael Sullivan","Filippo Moment\\`e","Luca Franceschetti","Philipp Sadler","Sherzod Hakimov","Alberto Testoni","Raffaella Bernardi","Raquel Fern\\'andez","Alexander Koller","Oliver Lemon","David Schlangen","Mario Giulianelli","Alessandro Suglia"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08590"}

However, deploying these models at ultra-high resolutions faces a critical trade-off between quality and efficiency due to the computational demands of long-range attention mechanisms. To address this, we introduce ZipIR, a novel framework that enhances efficiency, scalability, and long-range modeling for high-res image restoration. ZipIR employs a highly compressed latent representation that compresses image 32x, effectively reducing the number of spatial tokens, and enabling the use of high-capacity models like the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Toward this goal, we propose a Latent Pyramid VAE (LP-VAE) design that structures the latent space into sub-bands to ease diffusion training. Trained on full images up to 2K resolution, ZipIR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods, offering unmatched speed and quality in restoring high-resolution images from severely degraded inputs.","authors":["Yongsheng Yu","Haitian Zheng","Zhifei Zhang","Jianming Zhang","Yuqian Zhou","Connelly Barnes","Yuchen Liu","Wei Xiong","Zhe Lin","Jiebo Luo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08591"}

Post-hoc approaches therein use a set of examples to specify a concept, and determine its embeddings in DNN latent space using data driven techniques. This proved useful to uncover biases between different target (foreground or concept) classes. However, given that the background is mostly uncontrolled during training, an important question has been left unattended so far: Are/to what extent are state-of-the-art, data-driven post-hoc C-XAI approaches themselves prone to biases with respect to their backgrounds? E.g., wild animals mostly occur against vegetation backgrounds, and they seldom appear on roads. Even simple and robust C-XAI methods might abuse this shortcut for enhanced performance. A dangerous performance degradation of the concept-corner cases of animals on the road could thus remain undiscovered. This work validates and thoroughly confirms that established Net2Vec-based concept segmentation techniques frequently capture background biases, including alarming ones, such as underperformance on road scenes. For the analysis, we compare 3 established techniques from the domain of background randomization on >50 concepts from 2 datasets, and 7 diverse DNN architectures.

Nevertheless, real-time, open-vocabulary semantic understanding of large-scale unknown environments is still an open problem. In this paper we present FindAnything, an open-world mapping and exploration framework that incorporates vision-language information into dense volumetric submaps. Thanks to the use of vision-language features, FindAnything bridges the gap between pure geometric and open-vocabulary semantic information for a higher level of understanding while allowing to explore any environment without the help of any external source of ground-truth pose information. We represent the environment as a series of volumetric occupancy submaps, resulting in a robust and accurate map representation that deforms upon pose updates when the underlying SLAM system corrects its drift, allowing for a locally consistent representation between submaps. Pixel-wise vision-language features are aggregated from efficient SAM (eSAM)-generated segments, which are in turn integrated into object-centric volumetric submaps, providing a mapping from open-vocabulary queries to 3D geometry that is scalable also in terms of memory usage. The open-vocabulary map representation of FindAnything achieves state-of-the-art semantic accuracy in closed-set evaluations on the Replica dataset. This level of scene understanding allows a robot to explore environments based on objects or areas of interest selected via natural language queries.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Neural Fidelity Calibration for Informative Sim-to-Real Adaptation","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning can seamlessly transfer agile locomotion and navigation skills from the simulator to real world. However, bridging the sim-to-real gap with domain randomization or adversarial methods often demands expert physics knowledge to ensure policy robustness. Even so, cutting-edge simulators may fall short of capturing every real-world detail, and the reconstructed environment may introduce errors due to various perception uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose Neural Fidelity Calibration (NFC), a novel framework that employs conditional score-based diffusion models to calibrate simulator physical coefficients and residual fidelity domains online during robot execution. Specifically, the residual fidelity reflects the simulation model shift relative to the real-world dynamics and captures the uncertainty of the perceived environment, enabling us to sample realistic environments under the inferred distribution for policy fine-tuning. Our framework is informative and adaptive in three key ways: (a) we fine-tune the pretrained policy only under anomalous scenarios, (b) we build sequential NFC online with the pretrained NFC's proposal prior, reducing the diffusion model's training burden, and (c) when NFC uncertainty is high and may degrade policy improvement, we leverage optimistic exploration to enable hallucinated policy optimization. Our framework achieves superior simulator calibration precision compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse robots with high-dimensional parametric spaces. We study the critical contribution of residual fidelity to policy improvement in simulation and real-world experiments. Notably, our approach demonstrates robust robot navigation under challenging real-world conditions, such as a broken wheel axle on snowy surfaces.","authors":["Youwei Yu","Lantao Liu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08604"}

This and the large volume of hateful online content prompted both practitioners', i.e., in content moderation or law enforcement, and researchers' interest in machine learning models to automatically classify instances of hate speech. Whereas most scientific works address hate speech classification as a binary task, practice often requires a differentiation into sub-types, e.g., according to target, severity, or legality, which may overlap for individual content. Hence, researchers created datasets and machine learning models that approach hate speech classification in textual data as a multi-label problem. This work presents the first systematic and comprehensive survey of scientific literature on this emerging research landscape in English (N=46). We contribute with a concise overview of 28 datasets suited for training multi-label classification models that reveals significant heterogeneity regarding label-set, size, meta-concept, annotation process, and inter-annotator agreement. Our analysis of 24 publications proposing suitable classification models further establishes inconsistency in evaluation and a preference for architectures based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

The proposed method is compared to prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in the current state of the art. The results provide evidence that our method effectively alleviates the limitations of previous works. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis using three datasets, CIFAR-100, Flowers102, and DTD, each representing a distinct domain, to investigate the impact of task order on model performance.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Tactile sensing enables vertical obstacle negotiation for elongate many-legged robots","abstract":"Many-legged elongated robots show promise for reliable mobility on rugged landscapes. However, most studies on these systems focus on motion planning in the 2D horizontal plane (e.g., translation and rotation) without addressing rapid vertical motion. Despite their success on mild rugged terrains, recent field tests reveal a critical need for 3D behaviors (e.g., climbing or traversing tall obstacles) in real-world application. The challenges of 3D motion planning partially lie in designing sensing and control for a complex high-degree-of-freedom system, typically with over 25 degrees of freedom. To address the first challenge, we propose a tactile antenna system that enables the robot to probe obstacles and gather information about the structure of the environment. Building on this sensory input, we develop a control framework that integrates data from the antenna and foot contact sensors to dynamically adjust the robot's vertical body undulation for effective climbing. With the addition of simple, low-bandwidth tactile sensors, a robot with high static stability and redundancy exhibits predictable climbing performance in complex environments using a simple feedback controller. Laboratory and outdoor experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to climb obstacles up to five times its height. Moreover, the robot exhibits robust climbing capabilities on obstacles covered with flowable, robot-sized random items and those characterized by rapidly changing curvatures. These findings demonstrate an alternative solution to perceive the environment and facilitate effective response for legged robots, paving ways towards future highly capable, low-profile many-legged robots.","authors":["Juntao He","Baxi Chong","Vincent R Nienhusser","Massimiliano Iaschi","Sehoon Ha","Daniel I.

However, handwritten data often contains user-identifiable information, such as unique handwriting styles and personal lexicon choices, which can compromise privacy and erode trust in AI services. Legislation like the ``right to be forgotten'' underscores the necessity for methods that can expunge sensitive information from trained models. Machine unlearning addresses this by selectively removing specific data from models without necessitating complete retraining. Yet, it frequently encounters a privacy-accuracy tradeoff, where safeguarding privacy leads to diminished model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage unlearning strategy for a multi-head transformer-based HTR model, integrating pruning and random labeling. Our proposed method utilizes a writer classification head both as an indicator and a trigger for unlearning, while maintaining the efficacy of the recognition head. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive exploration of machine unlearning within HTR tasks. We further employ Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning user-identifiable information.

CryptoChaos harnesses the intrinsic unpredictability of four discrete chaotic maps (Logistic, Chebyshev, Tent, and Henon) to generate a high-entropy, multidimensional key from a unified entropy pool. This key is derived through a layered process that combines SHA3-256 hashing with an ephemeral X25519 Diffie-Hellman key exchange and is refined using an HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF). The resulting encryption key powers AES-GCM, providing both confidentiality and integrity. Comprehensive benchmarking against established symmetric ciphers confirms that CryptoChaos attains near-maximal Shannon entropy (approximately 8 bits per byte) and exhibits negligible adjacent-byte correlations, while robust performance on the NIST SP 800-22 test suite underscores its statistical rigor. Moreover, quantum simulations demonstrate that the additional complexity inherent in chaotic key generation dramatically elevates the resource requirements for Grover-based quantum attacks, with an estimated T gate count of approximately 2.1 x 10^9.

The non-stationary environment results in distribution shifts and, consequently, a degradation in accuracy. Continuous learning of the deployed model with new data could be one remedy. However, the question arises as to how we should update the model with new training data so that it retains its accuracy on the old data while adapting to the new data. In this work, we propose a task-conditioned ensemble of models to maintain the performance of the existing model.

In this regard, we evaluated three deep-learning models widely used in computer vision including shallow convolutional neural networks, residual neural networks, and vision transformers on two performance metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated these models using explainability methods to gain insight into their ability to capture the relevant feature information from their inputs.

Unlike conventional diffusion autoencoders operating in image space, LDAE applies the diffusion process in a compressed latent representation, improving computational efficiency and making 3D medical imaging representation learning tractable. To validate the proposed approach, we explore two key hypotheses: (i) LDAE effectively captures meaningful semantic representations on 3D brain MR associated with AD and ageing, and (ii) LDAE achieves high-quality image generation and reconstruction while being computationally efficient. Experimental results support both hypotheses: (i) linear-probe evaluations demonstrate promising diagnostic performance for AD (ROC-AUC: 90%, ACC: 84%) and age prediction (MAE: 4.1 years, RMSE: 5.2 years); (ii) the learned semantic representations enable attribute manipulation, yielding anatomically plausible modifications; (iii) semantic interpolation experiments show strong reconstruction of missing scans, with SSIM of 0.969 (MSE: 0.0019) for a 6-month gap. Even for longer gaps (24 months), the model maintains robust performance (SSIM > 0.93, MSE < 0.004), indicating an ability to capture temporal progression trends; (iv) compared to conventional diffusion autoencoders, LDAE significantly increases inference throughput (20x faster) while also enhancing reconstruction quality. These findings position LDAE as a promising framework for scalable medical imaging applications, with the potential to serve as a foundation model for medical image analysis.

The constructive nature of apartness allows the definition of derivation systems for reasoning about apartness of states. It further corresponds closely to distinguishing formulas in suitable modal logics. Both the derivations and distinguishing formulas provide (finite) evidence for differences in the behaviour of states. The current paper provides a derivation system in the setting of behavioural distances on labelled Markov chains. Rather than showing pairs of states apart, the system allows the derivation of lower bounds on their distance, complementing existing work giving upper bounds. We further show the soundness and (approximate) completeness of the system with respect to the behavioural distance. We go on to give a constructive correspondence between our derivation system and formulas in a modal logic with quantitative semantics. This logic was used in recent work of Rady and van Breugel to construct evidence for lower bounds on behavioural distances. Our constructions will provide smaller witnessing formulas in many examples.","authors":["Ruben Turkenburg","Harsh Beohar","Franck van Breugel","Clemens Kupke","Jurriaan Rot"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08639"}

Emerging behaviour of game-theoretic LLM agents","abstract":"There is general agreement that fostering trust and cooperation within the AI development ecosystem is essential to promote the adoption of trustworthy AI systems. By embedding Large Language Model (LLM) agents within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework, this paper investigates the complex interplay between AI developers, regulators and users, modelling their strategic choices under different regulatory scenarios. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by each actor, and LLMs provide additional degrees of complexity and nuances and enable repeated games and incorporation of personality traits. Our research identifies emerging behaviours of strategic AI agents, which tend to adopt more \"pessimistic\" (not trusting and defective) stances than pure game-theoretic agents. We observe that, in case of full trust by users, incentives are effective to promote effective regulation; however, conditional trust may deteriorate the \"social pact\". Establishing a virtuous feedback between users' trust and regulators' reputation thus appears to be key to nudge developers towards creating safe AI. However, the level at which this trust emerges may depend on the specific LLM used for testing. Our results thus provide guidance for AI regulation systems, and help predict the outcome of strategic LLM agents, should they be used to aid regulation itself.","authors":["Alessio Buscemi","Daniele Proverbio","Paolo Bova","Nataliya Balabanova","Adeela Bashir","Theodor Cimpeanu","Henrique Correia da Fonseca","Manh Hong Duong","Elias Fernandez Domingos","Antonio M.

However, even recent T2V models find it challenging to follow text descriptions accurately, especially when the prompt requires accurate control of spatial layouts or object trajectories. A recent line of research uses layout guidance for T2V models that require fine-tuning or iterative manipulation of the attention map during inference time. This significantly increases the memory requirement, making it difficult to adopt a large T2V model as a backbone. To address this, we introduce Video-MSG, a training-free Guidance method for T2V generation based on Multimodal planning and Structured noise initialization. Video-MSG consists of three steps, where in the first two steps, Video-MSG creates Video Sketch, a fine-grained spatio-temporal plan for the final video, specifying background, foreground, and object trajectories, in the form of draft video frames. In the last step, Video-MSG guides a downstream T2V diffusion model with Video Sketch through noise inversion and denoising. Notably, Video-MSG does not need fine-tuning or attention manipulation with additional memory during inference time, making it easier to adopt large T2V models. Video-MSG demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing text alignment with multiple T2V backbones (VideoCrafter2 and CogVideoX-5B) on popular T2V generation benchmarks (T2VCompBench and VBench). We provide comprehensive ablation studies about noise inversion ratio, different background generators, background object detection, and foreground object segmentation.","authors":["Jialu Li","Shoubin Yu","Han Lin","Jaemin Cho","Jaehong Yoon","Mohit Bansal"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08641"}

However, information extraction (IE) from building drawings is often time-consuming and costly, especially when dealing with historical buildings. Drawing search can be simplified by leveraging the information stored in the title block portion of the drawing, which can be seen as drawing metadata. However, title block IE can be complex especially when dealing with historical drawings which do not follow existing standards for uniformity. This work performs a comparison of existing methods for this kind of IE task, and then proposes a novel title block detection and IE pipeline which outperforms existing methods, in particular when dealing with complex, noisy historical drawings. The pipeline is obtained by combining a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network and GPT-4o, the proposed inference pipeline detects building engineering title blocks with high accuracy, and then extract structured drawing metadata from the title blocks, which can be used for drawing search, filtering and grouping. The work demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency in IE for both vector (CAD) and hand-drawn (historical) drawings. A user interface (UI) that leverages the extracted metadata for drawing search is established and deployed on real projects, which demonstrates significant time savings.

Unlike human-robot interaction, which benefits from established datasets and frameworks, animal-robot interaction lacks the foundational resources needed to facilitate meaningful bidirectional communication. To bridge this gap, we present the MBE-ARI (Multimodal Bidirectional Engagement in Animal-Robot Interaction), a novel multimodal dataset that captures detailed interactions between a legged robot and cows. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D streams from multiple viewpoints, annotated with body pose and activity labels across interaction phases, offering an unprecedented level of detail for ARI research. Additionally, we introduce a full-body pose estimation model tailored for quadruped animals, capable of tracking 39 keypoints with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92.7%, outperforming existing benchmarks in animal pose estimation. The MBE-ARI dataset and our pose estimation framework lay a robust foundation for advancing research in animal-robot interaction, providing essential tools for developing perception, reasoning, and interaction frameworks needed for effective collaboration between robots and animals.

This disease is the second most common type of cancer globally and the second most common cause of death in Vietnam, just after liver cancer, with 23,797 fatal cases and 26,262 new cases, or 14.4% of the disease in 2020. Recently, with rising disease rates in Vietnam causing a huge public health burden, lung cancer continues to hold the top position in attention and care. Especially together with climate change, under a variety of types of pollution, deforestation, and modern lifestyles, lung cancer risks are on red alert, particularly in Vietnam. To understand more about the severe disease sources in Vietnam from a diversity of key factors, including environmental features and the current health state, with a particular emphasis on Vietnam's distinct socioeconomic and ecological context, we utilize large datasets such as patient health records and environmental indicators containing necessary information, such as deforestation rate, green cover rate, air pollution, and lung cancer risks, that is collected from well-known governmental sharing websites. Then, we process and connect them and apply analytical methods (heatmap, information gain, p-value, spearman correlation) to determine causal correlations influencing lung cancer risks. Moreover, we deploy machine learning (ML) models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-mean clustering) to discover cancer risk patterns. Our experimental results, leveraged by the aforementioned ML models to identify the disease patterns, are promising, particularly, the models as Random Forest, SVM, and PCA are working well on the datasets and give high accuracy (99%), however, the K means clustering has very low accuracy (10%) and does not fit the datasets.","authors":["Ngoc Hong Tran","Lan Kim Vien","Ngoc-Thao Thi Le"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08651"}

However, existing methods focus solely on predicting positions without considering articulation, and only when the hands are visible in the field of view. This limitation overlooks the fact that approximate hand positions can still be inferred even when they are outside the camera's view. In this paper, we propose a method to forecast the 3D trajectories and poses of both hands from an egocentric video, both in and out of the field of view. We propose a diffusion-based transformer architecture for Egocentric Hand Forecasting, EgoH4, which takes as input the observation sequence and camera poses, then predicts future 3D motion and poses for both hands of the camera wearer. We leverage full-body pose information, allowing other joints to provide constraints on hand motion. We denoise the hand and body joints along with a visibility predictor for hand joints and a 3D-to-2D reprojection loss that minimizes the error when hands are in-view. We evaluate EgoH4 on the Ego-Exo4D dataset, combining subsets with body and hand annotations. We train on 156K sequences and evaluate on 34K sequences, respectively. EgoH4 improves the performance by 3.4cm and 5.1cm over the baseline in terms of ADE for hand trajectory forecasting and MPJPE for hand pose forecasting.

This adaptation is viable even on OBCs powered solely by Central Processing Units (CPUs), as it incorporates the use of an external Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). We demonstrate that, compared to Adaptive Breakpoint Detector (ABD), the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) in scaled autonomous racing, TinyCenterSpeed not only improves detection and velocity estimation by up to 61.38% but also supports multi-opponent detection and estimation.

Moreover, deep learning estimators require large amounts of training data, computational resources, and true channels to produce accurate channel estimates, which are not realistic. To address this, a convolutional neural tangent kernel (CNTK) is derived from an infinitely wide convolutional network whose training dynamics can be expressed by a closed-form equation. This CNTK is used to impute the target matrix and estimate the missing channel response using only the known values available at pilot locations. This is a promising solution for channel estimation that does not require a large training set. Numerical results on realistic channel datasets demonstrate that our strategy accurately estimates the channels without a large dataset and significantly outperforms deep learning methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and computational resources.","authors":["Mohammed Mallik","Guillaume Villemaud"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08660"}

However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with unseen environments or dynamic constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, we propose, Safe Flow Matching (SafeFM), a motion planning approach for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. By incorporating the proposed flow matching barrier functions, SafeFM ensures that generated trajectories remain within safe regions throughout the planning horizon, even in the presence of previously unseen obstacles or state-action constraints. Unlike diffusion-based approaches, our method allows for direct, efficient sampling of constraint-satisfying trajectories, making it well-suited for real-time motion planning. We evaluate SafeFM on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety, generalization, and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

In this paper, we combine Triadic Concept Analysis (TCA) and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting to suggest the user-story set required to develop a new system relying on the variability logic of an existing system family.

The parameter in question is the nesting width, a measure of the extent to which a graph can be represented as a nested collection of graphs. We present a novel directed graph decomposition called the acyclic-connected tree (A-C tree), which breaks the graph into a recursively nested sequence of strongly connected components in topological order. We prove that the A-C tree is optimal in the sense that its width, the size of the largest nested graph, is equal to the nesting width of the graph. We then provide a linear-time algorithm for constructing the A-C tree of any graph. Finally, we show how the A-C tree allows us to construct a simple variant of Dijkstra's algorithm which achieves a time complexity of $O(e+n\\log w)$, where $n$ ($e$) is the number of nodes (arcs) in the graph and $w$ is the nesting width. The idea is to apply the shortest path algorithm separately to each component in the order dictated by the A-C tree. We obtain an asymptotic improvement over Dijkstra's algorithm: when $w=n$, our algorithm reduces to Dijkstra's algorithm, but it is faster when $w \\in o(n)$, and linear-time for classes of graphs with bounded width, such as directed acyclic graphs.","authors":["Elis Stefansson","Oliver Biggar","Karl H.

This paper bridges Artificial Intelligence design for children -- an emerging field still defining its best practices -- and children's animation, a well-established field with decades of experience in engaging young viewers through emotionally resonant, cognitively accessible storytelling. Pairing Piagetian developmental theory with design pattern extraction from 52 works of Disney animation, the paper presents six design insights transferable to child-centred AI interface design: (1) emotional expressiveness and visual clarity, (2) musical and auditory scaffolding, (3) audiovisual synchrony for emotional comfort, (4) sidekick-style personas, (5) support for symbolic play and imaginative exploration, and (6) predictable and scaffolded interaction structures. These strategies -- long refined in Disney animation -- function as multimodal scaffolds for attention, understanding, and emotional attunement, thereby forming a structured design grammar familiar to children and transferable to AI interface design. By reframing cinematic storytelling as design logic for AI, the paper offers heuristics for crafting intuitive AI interfaces that align with children's cognitive stages and emotional needs. The work contributes to design theory by showing how sensory, affective and narrative techniques can inform developmentally attuned AI design for children.

We propose X2BR, a hybrid neural implicit framework that combines continuous volumetric reconstruction with template-guided non-rigid registration. The core network, X2B, employs a ConvNeXt-based encoder to extract spatial features from X-rays and predict high-fidelity 3D bone occupancy fields without relying on statistical shape models. To further refine anatomical accuracy, X2BR integrates a patient-specific template mesh, constructed using YOLOv9-based detection and the SKEL biomechanical skeleton model. The coarse reconstruction is aligned to the template using geodesic-based coherent point drift, enabling anatomically consistent 3D bone volumes. Experimental results on a clinical dataset show that X2B achieves the highest numerical accuracy, with an IoU of 0.952 and Chamfer-L1 distance of 0.005, outperforming recent baselines including X2V and D2IM-Net. Building on this, X2BR incorporates anatomical priors via YOLOv9-based bone detection and biomechanical template alignment, leading to reconstructions that, while slightly lower in IoU (0.875), offer superior anatomical realism, especially in rib curvature and vertebral alignment.

Prior research suggests that feedback delivered through dialogues, such as those in writing center tutoring sessions, can help writers reflect more thoughtfully on their work compared to static feedback. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and expressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that LLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters, allowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up questions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that voice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange, encouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating iterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared to text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a formative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers' reflection and subsequent revisions. Findings from this study will inform the design of intelligent and interactive writing tools, offering insights into how voice-based interactions with LLM-powered conversational agents can support reflection and revision.","authors":["Jiho Kim","Philippe Laban","Xiang 'Anthony' Chen","Kenneth C.

However, the performance of existing task decomposition methods can be suboptimal when the task contains overly complex logic and constraints. In this situation, the solution generated by LLMs may deviate from the original purpose of the task, or contain redundant or even erroneous content. Therefore, inspired by the fact that humans possess two thinking systems including fast thinking and slow thinking, this paper introduces a new task decomposition method termed ``Fast-Slow-Thinking'' (FST), which stimulates LLMs to solve tasks through the cooperation of Fast Thinking (FT) and Slow Thinking (ST) steps. Here FT focuses more on the general and concise aspect of the task, and ST focuses more on the details of the task. In FT, LLMs are prompted to remove the constraints of the original task, therefore simplifying it to a general and concise one. In ST, we recall the constraints removed in FT, so that LLMs can improve the answer generated in FT to meet the requirements of the original task. Therefore, our FST method enables LLMs to consider a complex problem via a human-like cognition process from coarse to fine, the effectiveness of which has been well demonstrated by the experiments on three types of tasks.","authors":["Yiliu Sun","Yanfang Zhang","Zicheng Zhao","Sheng Wan","Dacheng Tao","Chen Gong"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08690"}

While existing benchmarks focus on basic plan validity, they neglect critical aspects such as route efficiency, POI appeal, and real-time adaptability. This paper introduces TP-RAG, the first benchmark tailored for retrieval-augmented, spatiotemporal-aware travel planning. Our dataset includes 2,348 real-world travel queries, 85,575 fine-grain annotated POIs, and 18,784 high-quality travel trajectory references sourced from online tourist documents, enabling dynamic and context-aware planning. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that integrating reference trajectories significantly improves spatial efficiency and POI rationality of the travel plan, while challenges persist in universality and robustness due to conflicting references and noisy data. To address these issues, we propose EvoRAG, an evolutionary framework that potently synergizes diverse retrieved trajectories with LLMs' intrinsic reasoning. EvoRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving spatiotemporal compliance and reducing commonsense violation compared to ground-up and retrieval-augmented baselines. Our work underscores the potential of hybridizing Web knowledge with LLM-driven optimization, paving the way for more reliable and adaptive travel planning agents.","authors":["Hang Ni","Fan Liu","Xinyu Ma","Lixin Su","Shuaiqiang Wang","Dawei Yin","Hui Xiong","Hao Liu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08694"}

SWE agents use a combination of reasoning, environment interaction and self-reflection to resolve issues thereby generating \"trajectories\". Analysis of SWE agent trajectories is difficult, not only as they exceed LLM sequence length (sometimes, greater than 128k) but also because it involves a relatively prolonged interaction between an LLM and the environment managed by the agent. In case of an agent error, it can be hard to decipher, locate and understand its scope. Similarly, it can be hard to track improvements or regression over multiple runs or experiments. While a lot of research has gone into making these SWE agents reach state-of-the-art, much less focus has been put into creating tools to help analyze and visualize agent output. We propose a novel tool called SeaView: Software Engineering Agent Visual Interface for Enhanced Workflow, with a vision to assist SWE-agent researchers to visualize and inspect their experiments. SeaView's novel mechanisms help compare experimental runs with varying hyper-parameters or LLMs, and quickly get an understanding of LLM or environment related problems. Based on our user study, experienced researchers spend between 10 and 30 minutes to gather the information provided by SeaView, while researchers with little experience can spend between 30 minutes to 1 hour to diagnose their experiment.","authors":["Timothy Bula","Saurabh Pujar","Luca Buratti","Mihaela Bornea","Avirup Sil"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08696"}

In contrast, span annotation - pointing out issues in the text by annotating their spans - can guide improvements and provide insights. Until recently, span annotation was limited to human annotators or fine-tuned encoder models. In this study, we automate span annotation with large language models (LLMs). We compare expert or skilled crowdworker annotators with open and proprietary LLMs on three tasks: data-to-text generation evaluation, machine translation evaluation, and propaganda detection in human-written texts. In our experiments, we show that LLMs as span annotators are straightforward to implement and notably more cost-efficient than human annotators. The LLMs achieve moderate agreement with skilled human annotators, in some scenarios comparable to the average agreement among the annotators themselves. Qualitative analysis shows that reasoning models outperform their instruction-tuned counterparts and provide more valid explanations for annotations.

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.","authors":["Hossein Shojaei","Hamid Rahmanei","Seyed Hossein Sadati"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08698"}

While Offline Reinforcement Learning enables the training of autonomous vehicles using such data, most available datasets lack meaningful reward labels. Reward labeling is essential as it provides feedback for the learning algorithm to distinguish between desirable and undesirable behaviors, thereby improving policy performance. This paper presents a novel pipeline for generating human-aligned reward labels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of absent reward signals in real-world datasets by generating labels that reflect human judgment and safety considerations. The pipeline incorporates an adaptive safety component, activated by analyzing semantic segmentation maps, allowing the autonomous vehicle to prioritize safety over efficiency in potential collision scenarios. The proposed pipeline is applied to an occluded pedestrian crossing scenario with varying levels of pedestrian traffic, using synthetic and simulation data. The results indicate that the generated reward labels closely match the simulation reward labels. When used to train the driving policy using Behavior Proximal Policy Optimisation, the results are competitive with other baselines. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in producing reliable and human-aligned reward signals, facilitating the training of autonomous driving systems through Reinforcement Learning outside of simulation environments and in alignment with human values.","authors":["Vinal Asodia","Zhenhua Feng","Saber Fallah"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08704"}

In response, we present BiFlex, a flexible robotic wrist that uses a soft buckling honeycomb structure to provides a natural bimodal stiffness response. The higher stiffness mode enables precise household object manipulation, while the lower stiffness mode provides the compliance needed to adapt to external forces. We design BiFlex to maintain a fingertip deflection of less than 1 cm while supporting loads up to 500g and create a BiFlex wrist for many grippers, including Panda, Robotiq, and BaRiFlex.

Beyond natural language processing, the transformer architecture has proven efficient in addressing tabular data problems and challenges the previously dominant gradient-based decision trees in these areas. However, this predictive power comes at the cost of intelligibility: Marginal feature effects are almost completely lost in the black-box nature of deep tabular transformer networks. Alternative architectures that use the additivity constraints of classical statistical regression models can maintain intelligible marginal feature effects, but often fall short in predictive power compared to their more complex counterparts. To bridge the gap between intelligibility and performance, we propose an adaptation of tabular transformer networks designed to identify marginal feature effects. We provide theoretical justifications that marginal feature effects can be accurately identified, and our ablation study demonstrates that the proposed model efficiently detects these effects, even amidst complex feature interactions. To demonstrate the model's predictive capabilities, we compare it to several interpretable as well as black-box models and find that it can match black-box performances while maintaining intelligibility.

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.","authors":["Sahil Sethi","David Chen","Thomas Statchen","Michael C.

Although the authors of ModernBERT report improved performance over DeBERTaV3 on several benchmarks, the lack of disclosed training data and the absence of comparisons using a shared dataset make it difficult to determine whether these gains are due to architectural improvements or differences in training data. In this work, we conduct a controlled study by pretraining ModernBERT on the same dataset as CamemBERTaV2, a DeBERTaV3 French model, isolating the effect of model design. Our results show that the previous model generation remains superior in sample efficiency and overall benchmark performance, with ModernBERT's primary advantage being faster training and inference speed. However, the new proposed model still provides meaningful architectural improvements compared to earlier models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Additionally, we observe that high-quality pre-training data accelerates convergence but does not significantly improve final performance, suggesting potential benchmark saturation.

The former challenge is addressed by Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms, in particular Bayesian Optimization (BO) using Gaussian Process (GP) models. An overview is provided of how BO can deal with challenges specific to architecture optimization, such as design variable hierarchy and multiple objectives: specific measures include ensemble infills and a hierarchical sampling algorithm. Evaluations might fail due to non-convergence of underlying solvers or infeasible geometry in certain areas of the design space. Such failed evaluations, also known as hidden constraints, pose a particular challenge to SBO/BO, as the surrogate model cannot be trained on empty results. This work investigates various strategies for satisfying hidden constraints in BO algorithms. Three high-level strategies are identified: rejection of failed points from the training set, replacing failed points based on viable (non-failed) points, and predicting the failure region. Through investigations on a set of test problems including a jet engine architecture optimization problem, it is shown that best performance is achieved with a mixed-discrete GP to predict the Probability of Viability (PoV), and by ensuring selected infill points satisfy some minimum PoV threshold. This strategy is demonstrated by solving a jet engine architecture problem that features at 50% failure rate and could not previously be solved by a BO algorithm.

Such operators can arise from the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), and are used in many simulation-based outer-loop tasks in science and engineering, such as PDE-constrained optimization, Bayesian inverse problems, and optimal experimental design. In these settings, the neural network approximations can be used as surrogate models to accelerate the solution of the outer-loop tasks. However, since outer-loop tasks in infinite dimensions often require knowledge of the underlying geometry, the approximation accuracy of the operator's derivatives can also significantly impact the performance of the surrogate model. Motivated by this, we analyze the approximation errors of neural operators in Sobolev norms over infinite-dimensional Gaussian input measures. We focus on the reduced basis neural operator (RBNO), which uses linear encoders and decoders defined on dominant input/output subspaces spanned by reduced sets of orthonormal bases. To this end, we study two methods for generating the bases; principal component analysis (PCA) and derivative-informed subspaces (DIS), which use the dominant eigenvectors of the covariance of the data or the derivatives as the reduced bases, respectively. We then derive bounds for errors arising from both the dimension reduction and the latent neural network approximation, including the sampling errors associated with the empirical estimation of the PCA/DIS. Our analysis is validated on numerical experiments with elliptic PDEs, where our results show that bases informed by the map (i.e., DIS or output PCA) yield accurate reconstructions and generalization errors for both the operator and its derivatives, while input PCA may underperform unless ranks and training sample sizes are sufficiently large.","authors":["Dingcheng Luo","Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry","Peng Chen","Omar Ghattas"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08730"}

While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\\bf{3 \\space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.","authors":["Tianwei Xiong","Jun Hao Liew","Zilong Huang","Jiashi Feng","Xihui Liu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08736"}

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is another potential technique for achieving resource-efficient communication enhancement. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative RIS-assisted SACE (R-SACE) mechanism with the goal of improving the systemic communication performance of the ISAC system in practical scenarios where the channel status information (CSI) is imperfectly known. In the proposed R-SACE mechanism, a dual-functional base station (BS) provides downlink communication services to both the communication user and the dynamically changing target that is detected using the communication signals. RIS assists in both sensing and communications of the BS. A typical scenario is investigated in which either or both the direct and RIS-assisted reflected communication links are available depending on sensing results. The average systemic throughput (AST) over the entire timeline of the R-SACE mechanism is maximized by jointly optimizing both temporal and spatial resources under the probabilistic constraint and the sensing performance, transmission power, and communication interference constraints. The non-convex probabilistic mixed optimization problem is transformed and then solved by the proposed fixed-point iterative (FPI) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FPI algorithm and R-SACE mechanism outperform the baseline algorithms and communication enhancement mechanisms in achieving higher systemic communication performance.","authors":["Xiaohui Li","Qi Zhu","Yunpei Chen","Chadi Assi","Yifei Yuan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07968"}

Numerical simulations of such problems by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) at high resolution are computationally too expensive for many-query scenarios, e.g., uncertainty quantification, remeshing applications, topology optimization, and so forth. This limitation has motivated the application of data-driven surrogate models, where the microscale computations are $\\textit{substituted}$ with a surrogate, usually acting as a black-box mapping between macroscale quantities. These models offer significant speedups but struggle with incorporating microscale physical constraints, such as the balance of linear momentum and constitutive models. In this contribution, we propose Equilibrium Neural Operator (EquiNO) as a $\\textit{complementary}$ physics-informed PDE surrogate for predicting microscale physics and compare it with variational physics-informed neural and operator networks. Our framework, applicable to the so-called multiscale FE$^{\\,2}\\,$ computations, introduces the FE-OL approach by integrating the finite element (FE) method with operator learning (OL). We apply the proposed FE-OL approach to quasi-static problems of solid mechanics. The results demonstrate that FE-OL can yield accurate solutions even when confronted with a restricted dataset during model development. Our results show that EquiNO achieves speedup factors exceeding 8000-fold compared to traditional methods and offers an optimal balance between data-driven and physics-based strategies.","authors":["Hamidreza Eivazi","Jendrik-Alexander Tr\\\"oger","Stefan Wittek","Stefan Hartmann","Andreas Rausch"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07976"}

Modern EEG models are based on neural networks, demanding a large amount of data to achieve high performance and generalizability. However, privacy concerns associated with EEG pose significant limitations to data sharing between different hospitals and institutions, resulting in the lack of large dataset for most EEG tasks. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple decentralized clients to collaboratively train a global model without direct communication of raw data, thus preserving privacy. For the first time, we investigate the cross-subject EEG classification in the FL setting. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework termed mixEEG. Specifically, we tailor the vanilla mixup considering the unique properties of the EEG modality. mixEEG shares the unlabeled averaged data of the unseen subject rather than simply sharing raw data under the domain adaptation setting, thus better preserving privacy and offering an averaged label as pseudo-label. Extensive experiments are conducted on an epilepsy detection and an emotion recognition dataset. The experimental result demonstrates that our mixEEG enhances the transferability of global model for cross-subject EEG classification consistently across different datasets and model architectures.

To increase rosacea awareness and to better assist physicians to make diagnosis on this disease, we propose an interpretable automatic rosacea detection method based on whitened cosine similarity in this paper. The contributions of the proposed methods are three-fold. First, the proposed method can automatically distinguish patients suffering from rosacea from people who are clean of this disease with a significantly higher accuracy than other methods in unseen test data, including both classical deep learning and statistical methods. Second, the proposed method addresses the interpretability issue by measuring the similarity between the test sample and the means of two classes, namely the rosacea class versus the normal class, which allows both medical professionals and patients to understand and trust the results.

Despite the extensive research that has been done on this topic, much of the focus has been on theoretical and simulation analysis. However, these security solutions face key implementation challenges, mostly pertaining to limitations of IoT hardware and variations of channel conditions, limiting their practical adoption. To address this research gap, we revisit the channel reciprocity assumption from an experimental standpoint using resource-constrained devices. Our experimental study reveals a significant degradation in channel reciprocity for low-cost devices due to the varying channel conditions. Through experimental investigations, we first identify key practical causes for the degraded channel reciprocity. We then propose a new wavelet-based CSI reconstruction technique using wavelet coherence and time-lagged cross-correlation to construct CSI data that are consistent between the two participating devices, resulting in significant improvement in channel reciprocity. Additionally, we propose a secret-key generation scheme that exploits the wavelet-based CSI reconstruction, yielding significant increase in the key generation rates.

Traditional approaches suffer from readout crosstalk for a neutral-atom quantum processor with a tightly spaced array. Although classical machine learning algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can improve fidelity, they are computationally expensive, making it difficult to scale them to large qubit counts. We present two simpler and scalable machine learning algorithms that realize matched filters for the readout problem. One is a local model that focuses on a single qubit, and the other uses information from neighboring qubits in the array to prevent crosstalk among the qubits. We demonstrate error reductions of up to 32% and 43% for the site and array models, respectively, compared to a conventional Gaussian threshold approach. Additionally, our array model uses two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and four orders of magnitude fewer multiplications and nonlinear function evaluations than a recent convolutional neural network approach, with only a minor (3.5%) increase in error across different readout times. Another strength of our approach is its physical interpretability: the learned filter can be visualized to provide insights into experimental imperfections. We also show that a convolutional neural network model for improved can be pruned to have 70x and 4000x fewer parameters, respectively, while maintaining similar errors. Our work shows that simple machine learning approaches can achieve high-fidelity qubit measurements while remaining scalable to systems with larger qubit counts.","authors":["Robert M.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Particle Hit Clustering and Identification Using Point Set Transformers in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers","abstract":"Liquid argon time projection chambers are often used in neutrino physics and dark-matter searches because of their high spatial resolution. The images generated by these detectors are extremely sparse, as the energy values detected by most of the detector are equal to 0, meaning that despite their high resolution, most of the detector is unused in a particular interaction. Instead of representing all of the empty detections, the interaction is usually stored as a sparse matrix, a list of detection locations paired with their energy values. Traditional machine learning methods that have been applied to particle reconstruction such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), however, cannot operate over data stored in this way and therefore must have the matrix fully instantiated as a dense matrix. Operating on dense matrices requires a lot of memory and computation time, in contrast to directly operating on the sparse matrix. We propose a machine learning model using a point set neural network that operates over a sparse matrix, greatly improving both processing speed and accuracy over methods that instantiate the dense matrix, as well as over other methods that operate over sparse matrices. Compared to competing state-of-the-art methods, our method improves classification performance by 14%, segmentation performance by more than 22%, while taking 80% less time and using 66% less memory.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals.

We propose two sets of methods, cross-block feature aggregation PCA (CFA-PCA) and moving average PCA (MA-PCA), designed for sparse and dense block signals, respectively. Both methods adaptively utilize block signal structures, applicable to non-Gaussian data with heterogeneous variances and non-diagonal covariance matrices. Specifically, the CFA method utilizes a block-wise U-statistic to aggregate and select block signals non-parametrically from data with unknown cluster labels. We show that the proposed methods are consistent for both clustering and signal recovery under mild conditions and weaker signal strengths than the existing methods without considering block structures of signals. Furthermore, we derive both statistical and computational minimax lower bounds (SMLB and CMLB) for high-dimensional clustering and signal recovery under block signals, where the CMLBs are restricted to algorithms with polynomial computation complexity. The minimax boundaries partition signals into regions of impossibility and possibility. No algorithm (or no polynomial time algorithm) can achieve consistent clustering or signal recovery if the signals fall into the statistical (or computational) region of impossibility. We show that the proposed CFA-PCA and MA-PCA methods can achieve the CMLBs for the sparse and dense block signal regimes, respectively, indicating the proposed methods are computationally minimax optimal. A tuning parameter selection method is proposed based on post-clustering signal recovery results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. A case study on global temperature change demonstrates their utility in practice.","authors":["Wu Su","Yumou Qiu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08332"}

We apply our results to quantify the speed of convergence to Gaussian of a randomly initialized fully connected neural network and its derivatives - evaluated in a finite number of inputs - when the initialization is Gaussian and the sizes of the inner layers diverge to infinity. Our results require mild assumptions on the activation function, and allow one to recover optimal rates of convergence in a variety of distances, thus improving and extending the findings of Basteri and Trevisan (2023), Favaro et al.

As an illustration, we apply our results to bound the total variation distance between the Bayesian posterior law of the neural network and its derivatives, and the posterior law of the corresponding Gaussian limit: this yields quantitative versions of a posterior CLT by Hron et al.

These disruptions can pose significant physical and psychological challenges for patients. Therefore, accurate seizure prediction can help mitigate these risks by enabling timely interventions, ultimately improving patients' quality of life. Traditionally, EEG signals have been the primary standard for seizure prediction due to their precision in capturing brain activity. However, their high cost, susceptibility to noise, and logistical constraints limit their practicality, restricting their use to clinical settings. In order to overcome these limitations, this study focuses on leveraging ECG signals as an alternative for seizure prediction. In this paper, we present a novel method for predicting seizures based on detecting anomalies in ECG signals during their reconstruction. By extracting time-frequency features and leveraging various advanced deep learning architectures, the proposed method identifies deviations in heart rate dynamics associated with seizure onset. The proposed approach was evaluated using the Siena database and could achieve specificity of 99.16\\%, accuracy of 76.05\\%, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.01/h, with an average prediction time of 45 minutes before seizure onset. These results highlight the potential of ECG-based seizure prediction as a patient-friendly alternative to traditional EEG-based methods.","authors":["Mohammad Reza Chopannavaz","Foad Ghaderi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08381"}

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables.

Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are two well established correlation coefficients, characterized by a symmetric form that ensures zero expected value between two pairs of rankings randomly chosen with uniform probability. However, in recent years, several weighted versions of the original Spearman and Kendall coefficients have emerged that take into account the greater importance of top ranks compared to low ranks, which is common in many contexts. The weighting schemes break the symmetry, causing a non-zero expected value between two random rankings. This issue is very relevant, as it undermines the concept of uncorrelation between rankings. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a standardization function $g(x)$ that maps a correlation ranking coefficient $\\Gamma$ in a standard form $g(\\Gamma)$ that has zero expected value, while maintaining the relevant statistical properties of $\\Gamma$.","authors":["Pierangelo Lombardo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08428"}

Current methods for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual intervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of data that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG with attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine learning and signal processing approaches. We trained/tuned all models on 72 manually annotated EEG recordings obtained during home-based monitoring from 18 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.05 y ($\\pm$5.02). We tested them on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.33 y ($\\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\\% of epochs.

To ensure reliable support, these models require high technological, spatial, and temporal resolution, leading to large-scale linear programming problems that are often computationally intractable. To address this challenge, conventional approaches rely on simplifying abstractions that trade accuracy for computational efficiency. Benders decomposition has been widely explored to improve computational efficiency in electricity capacity expansion models. Specifically, state-of-the-art methods have primarily focused on improving performance through temporal decomposition. However, multi-sector models introduce additional complexity, requiring new decomposition strategies. In this work, we propose a budget-based formulation to extend decomposition to the sectoral and spatial domains. We test the developed sectoral and spatial Benders decomposition algorithms on case studies of the continental United States, considering different configurations in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. Results show that our algorithms achieve substantial performance improvement compared to existing decomposition algorithms, with runtime reductions within 15%-70%. The proposed methods leverage the generic structure of multi-sector capacity expansion models, and can thus be applied to most existing energy planning models, ensuring computational tractability without sacrificing resolution.","authors":["Federico Parolin","Yu Weng","Paolo Colbertaldo","Ruaridh Macdonald"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08503"}

However, timbre information from the source speaker is inherently embedded in the content representations, causing significant timbre leakage and reducing similarity to the target speaker. To address this, we introduce a residual block to a content extractor. The residual block consists of two weighted branches: 1) universal semantic dictionary based Content Feature Re-expression (CFR) module, supplying timbre-free content representation. 2) skip connection to the original content layer, providing complementary fine-grained information. In the CFR module, each dictionary entry in the universal semantic dictionary represents a phoneme class, computed statistically using speech from multiple speakers, creating a stable, speaker-independent semantic set. We introduce a CFR method to obtain timbre-free content representations by expressing each content frame as a weighted linear combination of dictionary entries using corresponding phoneme posteriors as weights. Extensive experiments across various VC frameworks demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates timbre leakage and significantly improves similarity to the target speaker.","authors":["Na Li","Chuke Wang","Yu Gu","Zhifeng Li"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08524"}

Behind the wide usage of over-parameterized networks is the belief that, if the data are simple, then the trained network will be automatically equivalent to a simple predictor. Following this intuition, many existing works have studied different notions of \"ranks\" of neural networks and their relation to the rank of data. In this work, we study the rank of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by gradient descent, with a specific focus on the robustness of the rank to image background noises. Specifically, we point out that, when adding background noises to images, the rank of the CNN trained with gradient descent is affected far less compared with the rank of the data. We support our claim with a theoretical case study, where we consider a particular data model to characterize low-rank clean images with added background noises. We prove that CNNs trained by gradient descent can learn the intrinsic dimension of clean images, despite the presence of relatively large background noises. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to further validate our claim.","authors":["Chenyang Zhang","Peifeng Gao","Difan Zou","Yuan Cao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08628"}

Pre-training on synthetic data improves relative distance error (RDE) and overall SELD score, with autocorrelation-based features reducing RDE by over 3 percentage points on the STARSS23 dataset.

However, such an ensemble brings heavy computation burdens in both training and certification, and yet under-exploits individual DNNs and their mutual effects, as the communication between these classifiers is commonly ignored in optimization. In this work, we consider a novel ensemble-based training way for a single DNN with multiple augmented heads, named as SmOothed Multi-head Ensemble (SOME). In SOME, similar to the pursuit of variance reduction via ensemble, an ensemble of multiple heads imposed with a cosine constraint inside a single DNN is employed with much cheaper training and certification computation overloads in RS. In such network structure, an associated training strategy is designed by introducing a circular communication flow among those augmented heads. That is, each head teaches its neighbor with the self-paced learning strategy using smoothed losses, which are specifically designed in relation to certified robustness. The deployed multi-head structure and the circular-teaching scheme in SOME jointly contribute to the diversities among multiple heads and benefit their ensemble, leading to a competitively stronger certifiably-robust RS-based defense than ensembling multiple DNNs (effectiveness) at the cost of much less computational expenses (efficiency), verified by extensive experiments and discussions.","authors":["Kun Fang","Qinghua Tao","Yingwen Wu","Tao Li","Xiaolin Huang","Jie Yang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10882"}

We address these limitations via IdealGPT, a framework that iteratively decomposes VL reasoning using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, IdealGPT utilizes an LLM to generate sub-questions, a VLM to provide corresponding sub-answers, and another LLM to reason to achieve the final answer. These three modules perform the divide-and-conquer procedure iteratively until the model is confident about the final answer to the main question. We evaluate IdealGPT on multiple challenging VL reasoning tasks under a zero-shot setting. In particular, our IdealGPT outperforms the best existing GPT-4-like models by an absolute 10% on VCR and 15% on SNLI-VE.

A popular approach to UCR is to fine-tune language models with external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs), but this usually requires a large number of training examples. In this paper, we propose to transform the downstream multiple choice question answering task into a simpler binary classification task by ranking all candidate answers according to their reasonableness. To this end, for training the model, we convert the knowledge graph triples into reasonable and unreasonable texts. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach on various multiple choice question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, compared with existing UCR approaches using KGs, ours is less data hungry.

These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as information extraction, question answering, sentiment analysis, document classification and many others. In the biomedical domain, significant progress has been made in adapting this paradigm to NLP tasks that require the integration of domain-specific knowledge as well as statistical modelling of language. In particular, research in this area has focused on the question of how best to construct LMs that take into account not only the patterns of token distribution in medical text, but also the wealth of structured information contained in terminology resources such as the UMLS. This work contributes a data-centric paradigm for enriching the language representations of biomedical transformer-encoder LMs by extracting text sequences from the UMLS. This allows for graph-based learning objectives to be combined with masked-language pre-training. Preliminary results from experiments in the extension of pre-trained LMs as well as training from scratch show that this framework improves downstream performance on multiple biomedical and clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.","authors":["Aidan Mannion","Thierry Chevalier","Didier Schwab","Lorraine Geouriot"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11170"}

One method to address this issue is to parallelize the computation by dividing the model in several partitions and using multiple CPUs to compute the result using techniques such as MPI and multi-threading. Alternatively, GPUs are also a good candidate to accelerate the computation due to their massively parallel architecture that allows many floating point operations per second to be performed. The numerical iterative solver takes thus the most computational time and is challenging to solve efficiently due to the dependencies that exist in the model between cells. In this work, we evaluate the OPM Flow simulator and compare several state-of-the-art GPU solver libraries as well as custom developed solutions for a BiCGStab solver using an ILU0 preconditioner and benchmark their performance against the default DUNE library implementation running on multiple CPU processors using MPI. The evaluated GPU software libraries include a manual linear solver in OpenCL and the integration of several third party sparse linear algebra libraries, such as cuSparse, rocSparse, and amgcl. To perform our bench-marking, we use small, medium, and large use cases, starting with the public test case NORNE that includes approximately 50k active cells and ending with a large model that includes approximately 1 million active cells. We find that a GPU can accelerate a single dual-threaded MPI process up to 5.6 times, and that it can compare with around 8 dual-threaded MPI processes.","authors":["Tong Dong Qiu","Andreas Thune","Vinicius Oliveira Martins","Markus Blatt","Alf Birger Rustad","Razvan Nane"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11488"}

At the same time, federated learning has received widespread attention due to its ability to protect data privacy when let models learn from data which is distributed across various clients. However, most existing works assume that the client's data are fixed. In real-world scenarios, such an assumption is most likely not true as data may be continuously generated and new classes may also appear. To this end, we focus on the practical and challenging federated class-incremental learning (FCIL) problem.

Chatbots, for example, are increasingly used as social companions, and while much is speculated, little is known empirically about how their use impacts human relationships. A common hypothesis is that relationships with companion chatbots are detrimental to social health by harming or replacing human interaction, but this hypothesis may be too simplistic, especially considering the social needs of users and the health of their preexisting human relationships. To understand how relationships with companion chatbots impact social health, we studied people who regularly used companion chatbots and people who did not use them. Contrary to expectations, companion chatbot users indicated that these relationships were beneficial to their social health, whereas non-users viewed them as harmful. Another common assumption is that people perceive conscious, humanlike AI as disturbing and threatening. Among both users and non-users, however, we found the opposite: perceiving companion chatbots as more conscious and humanlike correlated with more positive opinions and more pronounced social health benefits. Detailed accounts from users suggested that these humanlike chatbots may aid social health by supplying reliable and safe interactions, without necessarily harming human relationships, but this may depend on users' preexisting social needs and how they perceive both human likeness and mind in the chatbot.","authors":["Rose E.

However, the features they learn often blend content and style information, which somewhat limits their generalization capabilities under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we adopt a causal generative perspective for multimodal data and propose contrastive learning with data augmentation to disentangle content features from the original representations. To achieve this, we begin by exploring image augmentation techniques and develop a method to seamlessly integrate them into pre-trained CLIP-like models to extract pure content features. Taking a step further, and recognizing the inherent semantic richness and logical structure of text data, we explore the use of text augmentation to isolate latent content from style features. This enables CLIP-like models' encoders to concentrate on latent content information, refining the representations learned by pre-trained CLIP-like models. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks, alongside enhanced robustness to various perturbations. These results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed methods in refining vision-language representations and advancing the state of the art in multimodal learning.","authors":["Yichao Cai","Yuhang Liu","Zhen Zhang","Javen Qinfeng Shi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16445"}

Existing methods, which rely on a point-based learning of prototypes, typically face two critical issues: 1) the learned prototypes have limited representation power and are not suitable to detect Out-of-Distribution (OoD) inputs, reducing their decision trustworthiness; and 2) the necessary projection of the learned prototypes back into the space of training images causes a drastic degradation in the predictive performance. Furthermore, current prototype learning adopts an aggressive approach that considers only the most active object parts during training, while overlooking sub-salient object regions which still hold crucial classification information. In this paper, we present a new generative paradigm to learn prototype distributions, termed as Mixture of Gaussian-distributed Prototypes (MGProto). The distribution of prototypes from MGProto enables both interpretable image classification and trustworthy recognition of OoD inputs. The optimisation of MGProto naturally projects the learned prototype distributions back into the training image space, thereby addressing the performance degradation caused by prototype projection. Additionally, we develop a novel and effective prototype mining strategy that considers not only the most active but also sub-salient object parts. To promote model compactness, we further propose to prune MGProto by removing prototypes with low importance priors. Experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, and Oxford-IIIT Pets datasets show that MGProto achieves state-of-the-art image recognition and OoD detection performances, while providing encouraging interpretability results.","authors":["Chong Wang","Yuanhong Chen","Fengbei Liu","Yuyuan Liu","Davis James McCarthy","Helen Frazer","Gustavo Carneiro"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00092"}

Multiple studies focus on bridging the LLMs to external tools to extend the application scenarios. However, the current LLMs' ability to perceive tool use is limited to a single text query, which may result in ambiguity in understanding the users' real intentions. LLMs are expected to eliminate that by perceiving the information in the visual- or auditory-grounded instructions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MLLM-Tool, a system incorporating open-source LLMs and multi-modal encoders so that the learned LLMs can be conscious of multi-modal input instruction and then select the function-matched tool correctly. To facilitate the evaluation of the model's capability, we collect a dataset featuring multi-modal input tools from HuggingFace. Another essential feature of our dataset is that it also contains multiple potential choices for the same instruction due to the existence of identical functions and synonymous functions, which provides more potential solutions for the same query. The experiments reveal that our MLLM-Tool is capable of recommending appropriate tools for multi-modal instructions.

First, we propose the learnable transformation alignment to bridge the domain gap between image and point cloud data, converting features into a unified representation space for effective comparison and matching.

This is because a constant speed results in a large minimum turning radius, thus producing paths with longer maneuvers and larger travel times. In contrast, multi-speed relaxation allows for slower speed sharp turns, thus producing more direct paths with shorter maneuvers and smaller travel times. Furthermore, the inability of the Dubins model to reduce speed could result in fast maneuvers near obstacles, thus producing paths with high collision risks.","authors":["James P.

The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the presented nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization endeavour for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics, removing the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semidefinite derivatives and the commmonly employed assumption that the nonlinear system should be linear-in-parameter(parameterized) condition. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be classified into a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state/input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous by guaranteeing convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.","authors":["Shimin Wang","Martin Guay","Richard D.

It uses a fast model to draft a block of tokens which are then verified in parallel by the target model, and provides a guarantee that the output is distributed identically to a sample from the target model. In prior works, draft verification is performed independently token-by-token. Surprisingly, we show that this approach is not optimal. We propose Block Verification, a simple draft verification algorithm that verifies the entire block jointly and provides additional wall-clock speedup. We prove that the proposed mechanism is optimal in the expected number of tokens produced each iteration and specifically is never worse than the standard token-level verification. Empirically, block verification provides modest but consistent wall-clock speedups over the standard token verification algorithm of 5%-8% in a range of tasks and datasets. Given that block verification does not increase code complexity, maintains the strong lossless guarantee of the standard speculative decoding verification algorithm, cannot deteriorate performance, and, in fact, consistently improves it, it can be used as a good default in speculative decoding implementations.","authors":["Ziteng Sun","Uri Mendlovic","Yaniv Leviathan","Asaf Aharoni","Jae Hun Ro","Ahmad Beirami","Ananda Theertha Suresh"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10444"}

However, as the realism of synthetic media continues to rapidly improve, it is vital to have an accurate understanding of just how susceptible people currently are to potentially being misled by convincing but false AI generated content. We conducted a perceptual study with 1276 participants to assess how capable people were at distinguishing between authentic and synthetic images, audio, video, and audiovisual media. We find that on average, people struggled to distinguish between synthetic and authentic media, with the mean detection performance close to a chance level performance of 50%. We also find that accuracy rates worsen when the stimuli contain any degree of synthetic content, features foreign languages, and the media type is a single modality. People are also less accurate at identifying synthetic images when they feature human faces, and when audiovisual stimuli have heterogeneous authenticity. Finally, we find that higher degrees of prior knowledgeability about synthetic media does not significantly impact detection accuracy rates, but age does, with older individuals performing worse than their younger counterparts. Collectively, these results highlight that it is no longer feasible to rely on the perceptual capabilities of people to protect themselves against the growing threat of weaponized synthetic media, and that the need for alternative countermeasures is more critical than ever before.","authors":["Di Cooke","Abigail Edwards","Sophia Barkoff","Kathryn Kelly"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16760"}

In this paper, we characterize the impacts of data non-IIDness due to censored feedback (a.k.a. selective labeling bias) on such bounds. Censored feedback is ubiquitous in many real-world online selection and classification tasks (e.g., hiring, lending, recommendation systems) where the true label of a data point is only revealed if a favorable decision is made (e.g., accepting a candidate, approving a loan, displaying an ad), and remains unknown otherwise. We first derive an extension of the well-known Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality, which characterizes the gap between empirical and theoretical data distribution CDFs learned from IID data, to problems with non-IID data due to censored feedback. We then use this CDF error bound to provide a bound on the generalization error guarantees of a classifier trained on such non-IID data. We show that existing generalization error bounds (which do not account for censored feedback) fail to correctly capture the model's generalization guarantees, verifying the need for our bounds. We further analyze the effectiveness of (pure and bounded) exploration techniques, proposed by recent literature as a way to alleviate censored feedback, on improving our error bounds. Together, our findings illustrate how a decision maker should account for the trade-off between strengthening the generalization guarantees of an algorithm and the costs incurred in data collection when future data availability is limited by censored feedback.","authors":["Yifan Yang","Ali Payani","Parinaz Naghizadeh"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09247"}

This allows efficient local approximation of the individual likelihood factors, which leads to an analytical solution for the integral defining the gradient expectation. We integrate the proposed gradient approximation as the expectation step in an EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm for maximizing ELBO and test against classical deterministic approaches in Bayesian inference, such as the Laplace approximation, Expectation Propagation and Mean-Field Variational Inference.

Unlike most state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE remains stable and physically consistent for $100$ years of autoregressive simulation with $100$ ensemble members. Long-term mean climatology from LUCIE's simulation of temperature, wind, precipitation, and humidity matches that of ERA5 data, along with the variability. We further demonstrate how well extreme weather events and their return periods can be estimated from a large ensemble of long-term simulations. We further discuss an improved training strategy with a hard-constrained first-order integrator to suppress autoregressive error growth, a novel spectral regularization strategy to better capture fine-scale dynamics, and finally an optimization algorithm that enables data-limited (as low as $2$ years of $6$-hourly data) training of the emulator without losing stability and physical consistency. Finally, we provide a scaling experiment to compare the long-term bias of LUCIE with respect to the number of training samples. Importantly, LUCIE is an easy to use model that can be trained in just $2.4$h on a single A-100 GPU, allowing for multiple experiments that can explore important scientific questions that could be answered with large ensembles of long-term simulations, e.g., the impact of different variables on the simulation, dynamic response to external forcing, and estimation of extreme weather events, amongst others.","authors":["Haiwen Guan","Troy Arcomano","Ashesh Chattopadhyay","Romit Maulik"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16297"}

However, they face persistent challenges such as data sparsity and heterogeneity, largely due to isolated client environments. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs), particularly large language models like ChatGPT, present an opportunity to surmount these issues through powerful, cross-task knowledge transfer. In this position paper, we systematically examine the convergence of FRSs and FMs, illustrating how FM-enhanced frameworks can substantially improve client-side personalization, communication efficiency, and server-side aggregation. We also delve into pivotal challenges introduced by this integration, including privacy-security trade-offs, non-IID data, and resource constraints in federated setups, and propose prospective research directions in areas such as multimodal recommendation, real-time FM adaptation, and explainable federated reasoning. By unifying FRSs with FMs, our position paper provides a forward-looking roadmap for advancing privacy-preserving, high-performance recommendation systems that fully leverage large-scale pre-trained knowledge to enhance local performance.","authors":["Zhiwei Li","Guodong Long","Chunxu Zhang","Honglei Zhang","Jing Jiang","Chengqi Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00004"}

However, existing methods typically fine-tune the parameters of LMMs to learn additional segmentation tokens and overfit grounding and segmentation datasets. Such a design would inevitably cause a catastrophic diminution in the indispensable conversational capability of general AI assistants. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks, observing drastic performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue, we present F-LMM -- grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations -- a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention mechanism of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers, we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits, which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data, but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs' original conversational ability. Additionally, with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained, F-LMM can be directly applied to complex tasks like reasoning segmentation, grounded conversation generation and visual chain-of-thought reasoning.

However, modern operating systems, implementing layout randomization in the kernel, diverge from these assumptions and operate on a separate memory model with communication through system calls. In this work, we relax Abadi et al.'s language assumptions while demonstrating that layout randomization offers a comparable safety guarantee in a system with memory separation. However, in practice, speculative execution and side-channels are recognized threats to layout randomization. We show that kernel safety cannot be restored for attackers capable of using side-channels and speculative execution and introduce a new condition, that allows us to formally prove kernel safety in the Spectre era. Our research demonstrates that under this condition, the system remains safe without relying on layout randomization. We also demonstrate that our condition can be sensibly weakened, leading to enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee kernel safety for safe system calls in the Spectre era.","authors":["Davide Davoli","Martin Avanzini","Tamara Rezk"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07278"}

However, the coordination of dual-arm systems for long-horizon tasks continues to pose significant challenges, stemming from the intricate temporal and spatial dependencies among sub-tasks, necessitating intelligent decisions regarding the allocation of actions between arms and their optimal execution order. Existing task planning methods predominantly focus on single-arm robots or rely on predefined bimanual operations to use large language models (LLMs) generate task sequence with linear temporal dependency, failing to fully leverage the capabilities of dual-arm systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DAG-Plan, a structured task planning framework tailored for dual-arm robots. DAG-Plan harnesses LLMs to decompose intricate tasks into actionable sub-tasks represented as nodes within a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Critically, DAG-Plan dynamically assigns these sub-tasks to the appropriate arm based on real-time environmental observations, enabling parallel and adaptive execution. We evaluate DAG-Plan on the Dual-Arm Kitchen Benchmark, comprising 5 sequential tasks with 44 sub-tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DAG-Plan over directly using LLM to generate linear task sequence, achieving 52.8% higher efficiency compared to the single-arm task planning and 48% higher success rate of the dual-arm task planning. Compared to iterative methods, DAG-Plan improving execution efficiency 84.1% due to its fewer query time.

Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by an order of magnitude. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.","authors":["Nathaniel Chodosh","Anish Madan","Simon Lucey","Deva Ramanan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13896"}
{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"DragPoser: Motion Reconstruction from Variable Sparse Tracking Signals via Latent Space Optimization","abstract":"High-quality motion reconstruction that follows the user's movements can be achieved by high-end mocap systems with many sensors. However, obtaining such animation quality with fewer input devices is gaining popularity as it brings mocap closer to the general public. The main challenges include the loss of end-effector accuracy in learning-based approaches, or the lack of naturalness and smoothness in IK-based solutions. In addition, such systems are often finely tuned to a specific number of trackers and are highly sensitive to missing data e.g., in scenarios where a sensor is occluded or malfunctions. In response to these challenges, we introduce DragPoser, a novel deep-learning-based motion reconstruction system that accurately represents hard and dynamic on-the-fly constraints, attaining real-time high end-effectors position accuracy. This is achieved through a pose optimization process within a structured latent space. Our system requires only one-time training on a large human motion dataset, and then constraints can be dynamically defined as losses, while the pose is iteratively refined by computing the gradients of these losses within the latent space. To further enhance our approach, we incorporate a Temporal Predictor network, which employs a Transformer architecture to directly encode temporality within the latent space. This network ensures the pose optimization is confined to the manifold of valid poses and also leverages past pose data to predict temporally coherent poses. Results demonstrate that DragPoser surpasses both IK-based and the latest data-driven methods in achieving precise end-effector positioning, while it produces natural poses and temporally coherent motion. In addition, our system showcases robustness against on-the-fly constraint modifications, and exhibits exceptional adaptability to various input configurations and changes.","authors":["Jose Luis Ponton","Eduard Pujol","Andreas Aristidou","Carlos Andujar","Nuria Pelechano"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14567"}

LearnedKV dramatically reduces LSM size through this tiered approach, leading to significant performance gains in both reads and writes. Extensive evaluations across diverse workloads show that LearnedKV outperforms state-of-the-art LSM-based solutions by up to 4.32x for read operations and 1.43x for writes.

To comprehensively evaluate fairness, we design novel metrics including Approach Averaged Metric and Utility Regularized Metric, which can avoid deceptive results. We also present an effective and robust post-processing technique, Bias Pruning with Fair Activations (BPFA), which improves fairness without requiring retraining or weight updates. Extensive experiments conducted with 12 representative forgery detection models demonstrate the value of the proposed dataset and the reasonability of the designed fairness metrics.

Although purely data-driven methods are available for ROM construction, schemes that allow to retain a portion of the physics tend to enhance the interpretability and generalization of ROMs. However, physics-based techniques can adversely scale when dealing with nonlinear systems that feature parametric dependencies. This study introduces a generative physics-based ROM that is suited for nonlinear systems with parametric dependencies and is additionally able to quantify the confidence associated with the respective estimates. A main contribution of this work is the conditioning of these parametric ROMs to features that can be derived from monitoring measurements, feasibly in an online fashion. This is contrary to most existing ROM schemes, which remain restricted to the prescription of the physics-based, and usually a priori unknown, system parameters. Our work utilizes conditional Variational Autoencoders to continuously map the required reduction bases to a feature vector extracted from limited output measurements, while additionally allowing for a probabilistic assessment of the ROM-estimated Quantities of Interest. An auxiliary task using a neural network-based parametrization of suitable probability distributions is introduced to re-establish the link with physical model parameters.

Consequently, the E2E SLA must be properly decomposed into partial SLAs that are assigned to each domain involved. In a network slice management system with a two-level architecture, comprising an E2E service orchestrator and local domain controllers, we consider that the orchestrator has access only to historical data regarding the responses of local controllers to previous requests, and this information is used to construct a risk model for each domain. In this study, we extend our previous work by investigating the dynamic nature of real-world systems and introducing an online learning-decomposition framework to tackle the dynamicity. We propose a framework that continuously updates the risk models based on the most recent feedback. This approach leverages key components such as online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers, which enhance the stability and robustness of the overall process.

However, iris images captured by different devices exhibit certain and device-related consistent differences, which has a greater impact on the classification algorithm for anti-spoofing. The iris of various races would also affect the classification, causing the risk of identity theft. So it is necessary to improve the cross-domain capabilities of the iris anti-spoofing (IAS) methods to enable it more robust in facing different races and devices. However, there is no existing protocol that is comprehensively available. To address this gap, we propose an Iris Anti-Spoofing Cross-Domain-Testing (IAS-CDT) Protocol, which involves 10 datasets, belonging to 7 databases, published by 4 institutions, and collected with 6 different devices. It contains three sub-protocols hierarchically, aimed at evaluating average performance, cross-racial generalization, and cross-device generalization of IAS models. Moreover, to address the cross-device generalization challenge brought by the IAS-CDT Protocol, we employ multiple model parameter sets to learn from the multiple sub-datasets. Specifically, we utilize the Mixture of Experts (MoE) to fit complex data distributions using multiple sub-neural networks. To further enhance the generalization capabilities, we propose a novel method Masked-MoE (MMoE), which randomly masks a portion of tokens for some experts and requires their outputs to be similar to the unmasked experts, which can effectively mitigate the overfitting issue of MoE. For the evaluation, we selected ResNet50, VIT-B/16, CLIP, and FLIP as representative models and benchmarked them under the proposed IAS-CDT Protocol.","authors":["Hang Zou","Chenxi Du","Ajian Liu","Yuan Zhang","Jing Liu","Mingchuan Yang","Jun Wan","Hui Zhang","Zhenan Sun"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09752"}

However, statistical heterogeneity in FL presents a key challenge, leading to a phenomenon of skewness in local model parameter distributions that researchers have largely overlooked. In this work, we propose the concept of parameter skew to describe the phenomenon that can substantially affect the accuracy of global model parameter estimation. Additionally, we introduce FedSA, an aggregation strategy to obtain a high-quality global model, to address the implication from parameter skew. Specifically, we categorize parameters into high-dispersion and low-dispersion groups based on the coefficient of variation. For high-dispersion parameters, Micro-Classes (MIC) and Macro-Classes (MAC) represent the dispersion at the micro and macro levels, respectively, forming the foundation of FedSA. To evaluate the effectiveness of FedSA, we conduct extensive experiments with different FL algorithms on three computer vision datasets. FedSA outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines by about 4.7% in test accuracy.","authors":["Junfeng Liao","Sifan Wang","Ye Yuan","Riquan Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11278"}

However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors & misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.","authors":["Peter Slattery","Alexander K.

Despite substantial advancements in deepfake detection over these years, the generalizability of existing methods against forgeries from unseen datasets or created by emerging generative models remains constrained. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot advantages of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose a novel approach that repurposes a well-trained VLM for general deepfake detection. Motivated by the model reprogramming paradigm that manipulates the model prediction via input perturbations, our method can reprogram a pre-trained VLM model (e.g., CLIP) solely based on manipulating its input without tuning the inner parameters. First, learnable visual perturbations are used to refine feature extraction for deepfake detection. Then, we exploit information of face embedding to create sample-level adaptative text prompts, improving the performance. Extensive experiments on several popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that (1) the cross-dataset and cross-manipulation performances of deepfake detection can be significantly and consistently improved (e.g., over 88\\% AUC in cross-dataset setting from FF++ to WildDeepfake); (2) the superior performances are achieved with fewer trainable parameters, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.","authors":["Kaiqing Lin","Yuzhen Lin","Weixiang Li","Taiping Yao","Bin Li"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02664"}

The framework comprises three parts: data processing, foundation system, and downstream applications. First, we comprehensively present our data processing pipeline, which transforms massive raw audio into a large-scale high-quality TTS dataset with rich annotations and a wide coverage of content, speaking style, and timbre. Then, we propose a language-model-based foundation TTS system. The speech signal is compressed into discrete semantic tokens via a semantic-aware speech tokenizer, and can be generated by a language model from the prompt text and audio. Then, a two-stage waveform generator is proposed to decode them to the high-fidelity waveform. We present two applications of this system: voice cloning for dubbing and human-like speech generation for chatbots. The experimental results demonstrate the solid in-context learning capability of FireRedTTS, which can stably synthesize high-quality speech consistent with the prompt text and audio. For dubbing, FireRedTTS can clone target voices in a zero-shot way for the UGC scenario and adapt to studio-level expressive voice characters in the PUGC scenario via few-shot fine-tuning with 1-hour recording. Moreover, FireRedTTS achieves controllable human-like speech generation in a casual style with paralinguistic behaviors and emotions via instruction tuning, to better serve spoken chatbots.","authors":["Hao-Han Guo","Yao Hu","Kun Liu","Fei-Yu Shen","Xu Tang","Yi-Chen Wu","Feng-Long Xie","Kun Xie","Kai-Tuo Xu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03283"}

Given the impact on financial decisions and compensation mechanisms, a critical question arises concerning the adversarial robustness of data attribution methods. However, there has been little to no systematic research addressing this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities and proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two methods, Shadow Attack and Outlier Attack, which generate manipulated datasets to inflate the compensation adversarially. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through \"shadow training\", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.

This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong r-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives.

We define three variants of this optimization problem being full, partial and budgeted anonymization. In each, the objective is to maximize the number of k-anonymous nodes, i.e., nodes for which there are at least k-1 equivalent nodes, according to a particular anonymity measure of structural node equivalence. We propose four new heuristic algorithms for solving the anonymization problem which we implement into a reusable computational framework. As a baseline, we use an edge sampling method introduced in previous work. Experiments on both graph models and 23 real-world network datasets result in three empirical findings. First, we demonstrate that edge deletion is the most effective graph alteration operation. Second, we compare four commonly used anonymity measures from the literature and highlight how the choice of anonymity measure has a tremendous effect on both the initial anonymity as well as the difficulty of solving the anonymization problem. Third, we find that the proposed algorithm that preferentially deletes edges with a larger effect on nodes at a structurally unique position consistently outperforms heuristics solely based on network structure. Our best performing algorithm retains on average 14 times more edges in full anonymization, and overall ensures a better trade-off between anonymity and data utility. In the budgeted variant, it achieves 4.8 times more anonymous nodes than the baseline.

Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.","authors":["Yu Fu","Jie He","Yifan Yang","Qun Liu","Deyi Xiong"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19075"}

This paper introduces a novel framework that synergistically integrates an attention-enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make Android malware detection and classification more effective. By carefully analyzing a mere 47 features out of over 9,760 available in the comprehensive CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020 dataset, our MLP-SVM model achieves an impressive accuracy over 99% in identifying malicious applications. The MLP, enhanced with an attention mechanism, focuses on the most discriminative features and further reduces the 47 features to only 14 components using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Despite this significant reduction in dimensionality, the SVM component, equipped with an RBF kernel, excels in mapping these components to a high-dimensional space, facilitating precise classification of malware into their respective families. Rigorous evaluations, encompassing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, confirm the superiority of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

However, aligning this side information with collaborative information from historical interactions poses significant challenges. The inherent biases within LLMs can skew recommendations, resulting in distorted and potentially unfair user experiences. On the other hand, propensity bias causes side information to be aligned in such a way that it often tends to represent all inputs in a low-dimensional subspace, leading to a phenomenon known as dimensional collapse, which severely restricts the recommender system's ability to capture user preferences and behaviours. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework named Counterfactual LLM Recommendation (CLLMR). Specifically, we propose a spectrum-based side information encoder that implicitly embeds structural information from historical interactions into the side information representation, thereby circumventing the risk of dimension collapse. Furthermore, our CLLMR approach explores the causal relationships inherent in LLM-based recommender systems. By leveraging counterfactual inference, we counteract the biases introduced by LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CLLMR approach consistently enhances the performance of various recommender models.","authors":["Guixian Zhang","Guan Yuan","Debo Cheng","Lin Liu","Jiuyong Li","Shichao Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20052"}

Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms.

Recent studies have shown that incorporating System 2 process into Transformers including large language models (LLMs), significantly enhances their reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, models that purely resemble System 2 thinking require substantially higher computational costs and are much slower to respond. To address this challenge, we present Dualformer, a single Transformer model that seamlessly integrates both the fast and slow reasoning modes. Dualformer is obtained by training on data with randomized reasoning traces, where different parts of the traces are dropped during training. The dropping strategies are specifically tailored according to the trace structure, analogous to analyzing our thinking process and creating shortcuts with patterns. At inference time, our model can be configured to output only the solutions (fast mode) or both the reasoning chain and the final solution (slow mode), or automatically decide which mode to engage (auto mode). In all cases, Dualformer outperforms the corresponding baseline models in both performance and computational efficiency: (1) in slow mode, Dualformer optimally solves unseen 30 x 30 maze navigation tasks 97.6% of the time, surpassing the Searchformer (trained on data with complete reasoning traces) baseline performance of 93.3%, while only using 45.5% fewer reasoning steps; (2) in fast mode, Dualformer completes those tasks with an 80% optimal rate, significantly outperforming the Solution-Only model (trained on solution-only data), which has an optimal rate of only 30%.

Humor is a culturally nuanced aspect of human language, presenting challenges for its understanding and generation. Humor generation necessitates a multi-hop reasoning process, with each hop founded on proper rationales. Although many studies, such as those related to GPT-o1, focus on logical reasoning with reflection and correction, they still fall short in humor generation. Due to the sparsity of the knowledge graph in creative thinking, it is arduous to achieve multi-hop reasoning. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a more robust framework for addressing the humor reasoning task, named LoL. LoL aims to inject external information to mitigate the sparsity of the knowledge graph, thereby enabling multi-hop reasoning. In the first stage of LoL, we put forward an automatic instruction-evolution method to incorporate the deeper and broader thinking processes underlying humor. Judgment-oriented instructions are devised to enhance the model's judgment capability, dynamically supplementing and updating the sparse knowledge graph. Subsequently, through reinforcement learning, the reasoning logic for each online-generated response is extracted using GPT-4o. In this process, external knowledge is re-introduced to aid the model in logical reasoning and the learning of human preferences. Finally, experimental results indicate that the combination of these two processes can enhance both the model's judgment ability and its generative capacity. These findings deepen our comprehension of the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and offer approaches to boost LLMs' creative abilities for cross-domain innovative applications.","authors":["Han Wang","Yilin Zhao","Dian Li","Xiaohan Wang","Gang Liu","Xuguang Lan","Hui Wang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10370"}

Despite this, two primary challenges persist: heterogeneity and heterophily. Each of these two challenges can significantly hinder the performance of GNNs. Heterogeneity refers to a graph with multiple types of nodes or edges, while heterophily refers to the fact that connected nodes are more likely to have dissimilar attributes or labels. Although there have been few works studying heterogeneous heterophilic graphs, they either only consider the heterophily of specific meta-paths and lack expressiveness, or have high expressiveness but fail to exploit high-order neighbors. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Heterophilic Spectral Graph Neural Network (H2SGNN), which employs two modules: local independent filtering and global hybrid filtering. Local independent filtering adaptively learns node representations under different homophily, while global hybrid filtering exploits high-order neighbors to learn more possible meta-paths. Extensive experiments are conducted on four datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed H2SGNN, which achieves superior performance with fewer parameters and memory consumption.

However, in real-world scenarios, challenges such as motion blur and insufficient illumination often limit the performance of standard frame-based cameras in delivering high-quality images. To address these limitations, we incorporate a transmittance adjustment device at the hardware level, enabling event cameras to capture both motion and exposure events for diverse 3D reconstruction scenarios. Motion events (triggered by camera or object movement) are collected in fast-motion scenarios when the device is inactive, while exposure events (generated through controlled camera exposure) are captured during slower motion to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and optimization of event-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our framework supports three modes: High-Quality Reconstruction using exposure events, Fast Reconstruction relying on motion events, and Balanced Hybrid optimizing with initial exposure events followed by high-speed motion events. On the EventNeRF dataset, we demonstrate that exposure events significantly improve fine detail reconstruction compared to motion events and outperform frame-based cameras under challenging conditions such as low illumination and overexposure. Furthermore, we introduce EME-3D, a real-world 3D dataset with exposure events, motion events, camera calibration parameters, and sparse point clouds. Our method achieves faster and higher-quality reconstruction than event-based NeRF and is more cost-effective than methods combining event and RGB data. E-3DGS sets a new benchmark for event-based 3D reconstruction with robust performance in challenging conditions and lower hardware demands.

As object detectors become more robust with models like YOLOv8, developing effective adversarial methodologies is increasingly challenging. We present Truck Adversarial Camouflage Optimization (TACO), a novel framework that generates adversarial camouflage patterns on 3D vehicle models to deceive state-of-the-art object detectors. Adopting Unreal Engine 5, TACO integrates differentiable rendering with a Photorealistic Rendering Network to optimize adversarial textures targeted at YOLOv8. To ensure the generated textures are both effective in deceiving detectors and visually plausible, we introduce the Convolutional Smooth Loss function, a generalized smooth loss function. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that TACO significantly degrades YOLOv8's detection performance, achieving an AP@0.5 of 0.0099 on unseen test data. Furthermore, these adversarial patterns exhibit strong transferability to other object detection models such as Faster R-CNN and earlier YOLO versions.","authors":["Adonisz Dimitriu","Tam\\'as Michaletzky","Viktor Remeli"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21443"}

While this approach is rapidly adaptable to changing user preferences, only preferences over the types of terrain that are already known by the semantic classifier can be expressed. In this paper, we hypothesize that a machine-learning-based alternative to the semantics-based paradigm above will allow for rapid cost assignment adaptation to preferences expressed over new terrains at deployment time without the need for additional training. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce and study PACER, a novel approach to costmap generation that accepts as input a single birds-eye view (BEV) image of the surrounding area along with a user-specified preference context and generates a corresponding BEV costmap that aligns with the preference context. Using both real and synthetic data along with a combination of proposed training tasks, we find that PACER is able to adapt quickly to new user preferences while also exhibiting better generalization to novel terrains compared to both semantics-based and representation-learning approaches.","authors":["Luisa Mao","Garrett Warnell","Peter Stone","Joydeep Biswas"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23488"}

To address this issue while tackling the challenge of segmenting tiny objects, recent studies have explored local-global fusion methods. These methods preserve fine details using local regions and capture long-range context information from downscaled global images. However, the necessity of multiple forward passes inevitably incurs significant computational overhead, adversely affecting inference speed.

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks.

For bounded uncertainties, we apply robust control techniques to derive a guaranteed upper bound on the H2-norm of the unknown true system. To this end, a single semidefinite program (SDP) needs to be solved, with complexity that is independent of the amount of data. Furthermore, we exploit the signal-to-noise ratio to provide a data-dependent condition, that characterizes whether the proposed parametrization can be employed. The modular formulation allows to extend this framework to controller synthesis with different performance criteria, input-output settings, and various system properties.

Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) has emerged as a promising solution due to its resilience in such environments. In this paper, we present RINO, a non-iterative RIO framework implemented in an adaptively loosely coupled manner. Building upon ORORA as the baseline for radar odometry, RINO introduces several key advancements, including improvements in keypoint extraction, motion distortion compensation, and pose estimation via an adaptive voting mechanism. This voting strategy facilitates efficient polynomial-time optimization while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in the radar module's pose estimation. The estimated uncertainty is subsequently integrated into the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Kalman filter framework. Unlike prior loosely coupled odometry systems, RINO not only retains the global and robust registration capabilities of the radar component but also dynamically accounts for the real-time operational state of each sensor during fusion. Experimental results conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that RINO reduces translation and rotation errors by 1.06% and 0.09{\\deg}/100m, respectively, when compared to the baseline method, thus significantly enhancing its accuracy.

While significant progress has been made in detecting deepfakes, the simultaneous manipulation of audio and visual modalities, sometimes at small parts or in subtle ways, presents highly challenging detection scenarios. To address these challenges, we present DiMoDif, an audio-visual deepfake detection framework that leverages the inter-modality differences in machine perception of speech, based on the assumption that in real samples -- in contrast to deepfakes -- visual and audio signals coincide in terms of information. DiMoDif leverages features from deep networks that specialize in visual and audio speech recognition to spot frame-level cross-modal incongruities, and in that way to temporally localize the deepfake forgery. To this end, we devise a hierarchical cross-modal fusion network, integrating adaptive temporal alignment modules and a learned discrepancy mapping layer to explicitly model the subtle differences between visual and audio representations. Then, the detection model is optimized through a composite loss function accounting for frame-level detections and fake intervals localization. DiMoDif outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Deepfake Detection task by 30.5 AUC on the highly challenging AV-Deepfake1M, while it performs exceptionally on FakeAVCeleb and LAV-DF.

In this paper, we propose a intuitive plugin that can be integrated into existing FL techniques to achieve Byzantine-Resilience. Key idea is to generate virtual data samples and evaluate model consistency scores across local updates to effectively filter out compromised edge devices. By utilizing this scoring mechanism before the aggregation phase, the proposed plugin enables existing FL techniques to become robust against Byzantine attacks while maintaining their original benefits. Numerical results on medical image classification task validate that plugging the proposed approach into representative FL algorithms, effectively achieves Byzantine resilience.

However, as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase, the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover, the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information.

The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution.

Specifically, we address the shortcomings of pixel-level $L_\\text{p}$ loss ($\\mathcal{L}_\\text{pix}$) in the GAN-based SR framework. Since $L_\\text{pix}$ is known to have a trade-off relationship against perceptual quality, prior methods often multiply a small scale factor or utilize low-pass filters. However, this work shows that these circumventions fail to address the fundamental factor that induces blurring. Accordingly, we focus on two points: 1) precisely discriminating the subcomponent of $L_\\text{pix}$ that contributes to blurring, and 2) only guiding based on the factor that is free from this trade-off relationship. We show that they can be achieved in a surprisingly simple manner, with an Auto-Encoder (AE) pretrained with $L_\\text{pix}$.

The brick kiln sector significantly contributes to economic development but also accounts for 8-14\\% of air pollution in India. Policymakers have implemented compliance measures to regulate brick kilns. Emission inventories are critical for air quality modeling and source apportionment studies. However, the largely unorganized nature of the brick kiln sector necessitates labor-intensive survey efforts for monitoring. Recent efforts by air quality researchers have relied on manual annotation of brick kilns using satellite imagery to build emission inventories, but this approach lacks scalability. Machine-learning-based object detection methods have shown promise for detecting brick kilns; however, previous studies often rely on costly high-resolution imagery and fail to integrate with governmental policies. In this work, we developed a scalable machine-learning pipeline that detected and classified 30638 brick kilns across five states in the Indo-Gangetic Plain using free, moderate-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our detections have a high correlation with on-ground surveys. We performed automated compliance analysis based on government policies. In the Delhi airshed, stricter policy enforcement has led to the adoption of efficient brick kiln technologies.

Unlike previous multimodal large language model (MLLM), Liquid achieves this integration using a single large language model (LLM), eliminating the need for external pretrained visual embeddings such as CLIP. For the first time, Liquid uncovers a scaling law that performance drop unavoidably brought by the unified training of visual and language tasks diminishes as the model size increases. Furthermore, the unified token space enables visual generation and comprehension tasks to mutually enhance each other, effectively removing the typical interference seen in earlier models. We show that existing LLMs can serve as strong foundations for Liquid, saving 100x in training costs while outperforming Chameleon in multimodal capabilities and maintaining language performance comparable to mainstream LLMs like LLAMA2. Liquid also outperforms models like SD v2.1 and SD-XL (FID of 5.47 on MJHQ-30K), excelling in both vision-language and text-only tasks. This work demonstrates that LLMs such as Qwen2.5 and GEMMA2 are powerful multimodal generators, offering a scalable solution for enhancing both vision-language understanding and generation.

However, achieving AGI necessitates more than just comprehension and reasoning. A crucial capability required is effective planning in diverse scenarios, which involves making reasonable decisions based on complex environments to solve real-world problems. Despite its importance, the planning abilities of current MLLMs in varied scenarios remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EgoPlan-Bench2, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the planning capabilities of MLLMs across a wide range of real-world scenarios. EgoPlan-Bench2 encompasses everyday tasks spanning 4 major domains and 24 detailed scenarios, closely aligned with human daily life. EgoPlan-Bench2 is constructed through a semi-automatic process utilizing egocentric videos, complemented by manual verification. Grounded in a first-person perspective, it mirrors the way humans approach problem-solving in everyday life. We evaluate 21 competitive MLLMs and provide an in-depth analysis of their limitations, revealing that they face significant challenges in real-world planning. To further improve the planning proficiency of current MLLMs, we propose a training-free approach using multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting through investigating the effectiveness of various multimodal prompts in complex planning. Our approach enhances the performance of GPT-4V by 10.24 on EgoPlan-Bench2 without additional training.

In recent years, the application of machine learning models in this domain has garnered significant scientific attention. When using historical execution data, which may contain biases or exhibit unfair behavior, these biases may be encoded into the trained models. Consequently, when such models are deployed to make decisions or guide interventions for new cases, they risk perpetuating this unwanted behavior. This work addresses group fairness in predictive process monitoring by investigating independence, i.e. ensuring predictions are unaffected by sensitive group membership. We explore independence through metrics for demographic parity such as $\\Delta$DP, as well as recently introduced, threshold-independent distribution-based alternatives. Additionally, we propose a composite loss function existing of binary cross-entropy and a distribution-based loss (Wasserstein) to train models that balance predictive performance and fairness, and allow for customizable trade-offs. The effectiveness of both the fairness metrics and the composite loss functions is validated through a controlled experimental setup.","authors":["Jari Peeperkorn","Simon De Vos"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04914"}

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training and obtaining the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithm following DeepSeek R1, to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model.

Zero-shot VLN-CE is particularly challenging due to the absence of expert demonstrations for training and minimal environment structural prior to guide navigation. To confront these challenges, we propose a Constraint-Aware Navigator (CA-Nav), which reframes zero-shot VLN-CE as a sequential, constraint-aware sub-instruction completion process. CA-Nav continuously translates sub-instructions into navigation plans using two core modules: the Constraint-Aware Sub-instruction Manager (CSM) and the Constraint-Aware Value Mapper (CVM). CSM defines the completion criteria for decomposed sub-instructions as constraints and tracks navigation progress by switching sub-instructions in a constraint-aware manner. CVM, guided by CSM's constraints, generates a value map on the fly and refines it using superpixel clustering to improve navigation stability. CA-Nav achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two VLN-CE benchmarks, surpassing the previous best method by 12 percent and 13 percent in Success Rate on the validation unseen splits of R2R-CE and RxR-CE, respectively.

In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines.

Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.","authors":["Zijie Zhou","Zhaoqi Lu","Xuekai Wei","Rongqin Chen","Shenghui Zhang","Pak Lon Ip","Leong Hou U"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15302"}

However, reading mathematical expressions aloud without accompanying visuals can significantly hinder comprehension, especially for those who are hearing-impaired or rely on subtitles due to language barriers. For instance, when a presenter reads Euler's Formula, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often produce a verbose and error-prone textual description (e.g., e to the power of i x equals cosine of x plus i $\\textit{side}$ of x), instead of the concise $\\LaTeX{}$ format (i.e., $ e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x) $), which hampers clear understanding and communication.

Such hyper-parameters are empirically grid-searched over validation data, and their configurations may vary substantially with the target dataset and pre-training model, making such empirical searches both sub-optimal and computationally intractable. In this work, we advocate and introduce the unrolling paradigm, also referred to as \"learning to optimize\", in the context of few-shot learning, thereby learning efficiently and effectively a set of optimized hyper-parameters.

In this paper, we introduce a novel hardness-driven strategy for MDA tasks, named \"A3MDA\" , which collectively considers these three aspects through Adaptive hardness quantification and utilization in both data Augmentation and domain Alignment.To achieve this, \"A3MDA\" progressively proposes three Adaptive Hardness Measurements (AHM), i.e., Basic, Smooth, and Comparative AHMs, each incorporating distinct mechanisms for diverse scenarios. Specifically, Basic AHM aims to gauge the instantaneous hardness for each source/target sample. Then, hardness values measured by Smooth AHM will adaptively adjust the intensity level of strong data augmentation to maintain compatibility with the model's generalization capacity.In contrast, Comparative AHM is designed to facilitate cluster-level constraints. By leveraging hardness values as sample-specific weights, the traditional MMD is enhanced into a weighted-clustered variant, strengthening the robustness and precision of inter-domain alignment. As for the often-neglected intra-domain alignment, we adaptively construct a pseudo-contrastive matrix by selecting harder samples based on the hardness rankings, enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels, and shaping a well-clustered target feature space.

The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness to sub-populations due to the varying user properties. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in enhancing RS performance, their practical applicability is hindered by high costs, inference latency, and degraded performance on long user queries. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework designed to promote social good by equitably serving all user groups. By adopting a two-phase approach, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task. We evaluate our hybrid framework by incorporating eight different recommendation algorithms and three different LLMs -- both open and close-sourced.

However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional MPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10\\%-30\\%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to PID controller, the MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates the MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.","authors":["Yi-Ping Chen","Vispi Karkaria","Ying-Kuan Tsai","Faith Rolark","Daniel Quispe","Robert X.

Motivated by high-stakes applications in which mistakes can be catastrophic, such as robotics and healthcare, we study situations where it is possible for fast sequential learning to occur. Fast sequential learning is characterized by the ability of the learning agent to incur logarithmic regret relative to a fully-informed baseline. We demonstrate that fast sequential learning is achievable in a diverse class of continuous control problems where the system dynamics depend smoothly on unknown parameters, provided the optimal control policy is persistently exciting. Additionally, we derive a regret bound which grows with the square root of the number of interactions for cases where the optimal policy is not persistently exciting. Our results provide the first regret bounds for controlling nonlinear dynamical systems depending nonlinearly on unknown parameters.

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"No Equations Needed: Learning System Dynamics Without Relying on Closed-Form ODEs","abstract":"Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is a crucial area of machine learning. In many scenarios, a thorough understanding of the model's behavior becomes essential for practical applications. For instance, understanding the behavior of a pharmacokinetic model, constructed as part of drug development, may allow us to both verify its biological plausibility (e.g., the drug concentration curve is non-negative and decays to zero) and to design dosing guidelines. Discovery of closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be employed to obtain such insights by finding a compact mathematical equation and then analyzing it (a two-step approach). However, its widespread use is currently hindered because the analysis process may be time-consuming, requiring substantial mathematical expertise, or even impossible if the equation is too complex. Moreover, if the found equation's behavior does not satisfy the requirements, editing it or influencing the discovery algorithms to rectify it is challenging as the link between the symbolic form of an ODE and its behavior can be elusive. This paper proposes a conceptual shift to modeling low-dimensional dynamical systems by departing from the traditional two-step modeling process. Instead of first discovering a closed-form equation and then analyzing it, our approach, direct semantic modeling, predicts the semantic representation of the dynamical system (i.e., description of its behavior) directly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This direct approach also allows the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases into the optimization algorithm and editing the model's behavior directly, ensuring that the model meets the desired specifications. Our approach not only simplifies the modeling pipeline but also enhances the transparency and flexibility of the resulting models compared to traditional closed-form ODEs.","authors":["Krzysztof Kacprzyk","Mihaela van der Schaar"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18563"}

This issue prompts plagiarism detection services to enhance their capabilities in identifying AI-generated content. Adversarial attacks are often used to test the robustness of AI-text generated detectors. This work proposes a novel textual adversarial attack on the detection models such as Fast-DetectGPT. The method employs embedding models for data perturbation, aiming at reconstructing the AI generated texts to reduce the likelihood of detection of the true origin of the texts. Specifically, we employ different embedding techniques, including the Tsetlin Machine (TM), an interpretable approach in machine learning for this purpose. By combining synonyms and embedding similarity vectors, we demonstrates the state-of-the-art reduction in detection scores against Fast-DetectGPT. Particularly, in the XSum dataset, the detection score decreased from 0.4431 to 0.2744 AUROC, and in the SQuAD dataset, it dropped from 0.5068 to 0.3532 AUROC.","authors":["Ahmed K.

In this paper, we present a unified multitask learning framework that combines these two types of labels and is thus able to be trained on multiple datasets. This framework uses an effective input representation that combines musical features (i.e., key and chords) and MERT embeddings. Moreover, knowledge distillation is employed to transfer the knowledge of teacher models trained on individual datasets to a student model, enhancing its ability to generalize across multiple tasks. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on a variety of datasets, including MTG-Jamendo, DEAM, PMEmo, and EmoMusic. According to our experimental results, the inclusion of musical features, multitask learning, and knowledge distillation significantly enhances performance. In particular, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models, including the best-performing model from the MediaEval 2021 competition on the MTG-Jamendo dataset.

SLA decomposition across multiple network domains, each potentially managed by different service providers, poses a significant challenge due to limited visibility into real-time underlying domain conditions. This paper introduces Risk-Aware Iterated Local Search (RAILS), a novel risk model-driven meta-heuristic framework designed to jointly address SLA decomposition and service provider selection in multi-domain networks. By integrating online risk modeling with iterated local search principles, RAILS effectively navigates the complex optimization landscape, utilizing historical feedback from domain controllers.

Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \\le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \\le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$.

Central to this process is the attention mechanism, which extracts interest representations with respect to candidate items from the user sequence. Typically, attention mechanisms operate in a point-wise manner, focusing solely on the relevance of individual items in the sequence to the candidate item. In contrast, context-aware LSM aims to also consider adjacent items in the user behavior sequence to better assess the importance of each item. In this paper, we propose the Context-Aware Interest Network (CAIN), which utilizes the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to create context-aware representations for each item throughout the lifelong sequence. These enhanced representations are then used in the attention mechanism instead of the original item representations to derive context-aware interest representations. Building upon this TCN framework, we propose the Multi-Scope Interest Aggregator (MSIA) module, which incorporates multiple TCN layers and their corresponding attention modules to capture interest representations across varying context scopes. Furthermore, we introduce the Personalized Extractor Generation (PEG) module, which generates convolution filters based on users' basic profile features. These personalized filters are then used in the TCN layers instead of the original global filters to generate more user-specific representations. We conducted extensive experiments on both a public dataset and an industrial dataset from the WeChat Channels platform. The results demonstrate that CAIN outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and online performance metrics.","authors":["Ting Guo","Zhaoyang Yang","Qinsong Zeng","Ming Chen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12634"}

Access refers to practical needs, infrastructurally, technically, and societally, in order to use available components in some way. We deconstruct access along three axes: resourcing, technical usability, and utility. Within each category, a set of variables per system component clarify tradeoffs. For example, resourcing requires access to computing infrastructure to serve model weights. We also compare the accessibility of four high performance language models, two open-weight and two closed-weight, showing similar considerations for all based instead on access variables. Access variables set the foundation for being able to scale or increase access to users; we examine the scale of access and how scale affects ability to manage and intervene on risks.

To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts.

In what was arguably the first Bayesian case study, Mosteller and Wallace (1963) provided the first statistical evidence for attributing all disputed papers to Madison. Our paper revisits this historical dataset but from a lens of modern language models, both small and large. We review some of the more popular Large Language Model (LLM) tools and examine them from a statistical point of view in the context of text classification. We investigate whether, without any attempt to fine-tune, the general embedding constructs can be useful for stylometry and attribution. We explain differences between various word/phrase embeddings and discuss how to aggregate them in a document. Contrary to our expectations, we exemplify that dimension expansion with word embeddings may not always be beneficial for attribution relative to dimension reduction with topic embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that default LLM embeddings (even after manual fine-tuning) may not consistently improve authorship attribution accuracy. Instead, Bayesian analysis with topic embeddings trained on ``function words\" yields superior out-of-sample classification performance. This suggests that traditional (small) statistical language models, with their interpretability and solid theoretical foundation, can offer significant advantages in authorship attribution tasks.

Few dedicated UniDA methods exist for Time Series (TS), which remains a challenging case. In general, UniDA approaches align common class samples and detect unknown target samples from emerging classes. Such detection often results from thresholding a discriminability metric. The threshold value is typically either a fine-tuned hyperparameter or a fixed value, which limits the ability of the model to adapt to new data. Furthermore, discriminability metrics exhibit overconfidence for unknown samples, leading to misclassifications. This paper introduces UniJDOT, an optimal-transport-based method that accounts for the unknown target samples in the transport cost. Our method also proposes a joint decision space to improve the discriminability of the detection module. In addition, we use an auto-thresholding algorithm to reduce the dependence on fixed or fine-tuned thresholds. Finally, we rely on a Fourier transform-based layer inspired by the Fourier Neural Operator for better TS representation. Experiments on TS benchmarks demonstrate the discriminability, robustness, and state-of-the-art performance of UniJDOT.","authors":["Romain Mussard","Fannia Pacheco","Maxime Berar","Gilles Gasso","Paul Honeine"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11217"}

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

While traditional practices involve hiring human caregivers to serve meals and attend to basic needs, older adults often require continuous companionship and health monitoring. However, hiring human caregivers for this job costs a lot of money. However, using a robot like Nao could be cheaper and still helpful. This study explores the integration of humanoid robots, particularly Nao, in health monitoring and caregiving for older adults. Using a mixed-methods approach with a within-subject factorial design, we investigated the effectiveness of nonverbal communication modalities, including touch, gestures, and LED patterns, in enhancing human-robot interactions. Our results indicate that Nao's touch-based health monitoring was well-received by participants, with positive ratings across various dimensions. LED patterns were perceived as more effective and accurate compared to hand and head gestures. Moreover, longer interactions were associated with higher trust levels and perceived empathy, highlighting the importance of prolonged engagement in fostering trust in human-robot interactions.

However, its meaning is far from universally agreed, and often it is easier to get opinions on what it is not, rather than what it is. In this paper, we solicit definitions of 'decentralization' and 'decentralization theatre' from blockchain node operators. Key to a definition is asking about effective decentralization strategies, as well as those that are ineffective, sometimes deliberately so. Malicious, deceptive, or incompetent strategies are commonly referred to by the term 'decentralization theatre.' Finally, we ask what is being decentralized. Via thematic analysis of interview transcripts, we find that most operators conceive decentralization as existing broadly on a technical and a governance axis. Isolating relevant variables, we collapse the categories to network topology and governance topology, or the structure of decision-making power.

However, the h-index only accounts for the number of citations received in a publication and does not account for other factors such as the number of authors or their specific contributions in collaborative works. Therefore, the h-index has been placed on scrutiny as it has motivated academic integrity issues where non-contributing authors get authorship merely for raising their h-index. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate existing metrics in their ability to account for authorship contribution by their position and introduce a novel variant of the h-index, known as the h-leadership index. The h-leadership index aims to advance the fair evaluation of academic contributions in multi-authored publications by giving importance to authorship position beyond the first and last authors, focused by Stanford's ranking of the top 2 \\% of world scientists. We assign weighted citations based on a modified complementary unit Gaussian curve, ensuring that the contributions of middle authors are appropriately recognised.

Initially proposed for linear time-invariant systems, several DeePC extensions are now available to cope with nonlinear systems. Nonetheless, these solutions mainly focus on ensuring the controller's effectiveness, overlooking the explainability of the final result. As a step toward explaining the outcome of DeePC for the control of nonlinear systems, in this paper, we focus on analyzing the earliest and simplest DeePC approach proposed to cope with nonlinearities in the controlled system, using a Lasso regularization. Our theoretical analysis highlights that the decisions undertaken by DeePC with Lasso regularization are unexplainable, as control actions are determined by data incoherent with the system's local behavior. This result is true even when the available input/output samples are grouped according to the different operating conditions explored during data collection. Our numerical study confirms these findings, highlighting the benefits of data grouping in terms of performance while showing that explainability remains a challenge in control design via DeePC.","authors":["Gianluca Giacomelli","Simone Formentin","Victor G.

Proving that these compilation chains are secure is, however, challenging, and involves a non-trivial back-translation step: for any attack a target context mounts against the compiled program one has to exhibit a source context mounting the same attack against the source program. We describe a novel back-translation technique, which results in simpler proofs that can be more easily mechanized in a proof assistant. Given a finite set of finite trace prefixes, capturing the interaction recorded during an attack between a target context and the compiled program, we build a call-return tree that we back-translate into a source context producing the same trace prefixes. We use state in the generated source context to record the current location in the call-return tree. The back-translation is done in several small steps, each adding to the tree new information describing how the location should change depending on how the context regains control. To prove this back-translation correct we give semantics to every intermediate call-return tree language, using ghost state to store information and explicitly enforce execution invariants. We prove several small forward simulations, basically seeing the back-translation as a verified nanopass compiler. Thanks to this modular structure, we are able to mechanize this complex back-translation and its correctness proof in the Rocq prover without too much effort.","authors":["J\\'er\\'emy Thibault","Joseph Lenormand","Catalin Hritcu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19609"}

In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.","authors":["Alejandro Ortega"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19887"}

While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing.

While ZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its constant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and destabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous voltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and topology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To address these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system comprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected according to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a local controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary topology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked ``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs. Subsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust (dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the dissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and globally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and embed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI problems, thus providing a one-shot approach (as opposed to iterative schemes) to solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper provides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches.","authors":["Mohammad Javad Najafirad","Shirantha Welikala"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21042"}

To address this, we propose a novel RL framework leveraging foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Instead of pursuing detailed actuator modeling and system identification, we utilize foot-mounted IMU measurements to enhance rapid stabilization capabilities over challenging terrains. Additionally, we propose symmetric data augmentation dedicated to the proposed observation space and random network distillation to enhance bipedal locomotion learning over rough terrain. We validate our approach through hardware experiments on a miniature-sized humanoid EVAL-03 over a variety of environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves rapid stabilization capabilities over non-rigid surfaces and sudden environmental transitions.","authors":["Sotaro Katayama","Yuta Koda","Norio Nagatsuka","Masaya Kinoshita"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00614"}

Our extensive experiments on balanced and imbalanced self-regulated learning datasets of Estonian primary school students predicting 7th-grade mathematics national test performance showed that symbolic and sub-symbolic methods performed well on balanced data but struggled to identify low performers in imbalanced datasets. Interestingly, symbolic and sub-symbolic methods emphasized different factors in their decision-making: symbolic approaches primarily relied on cognitive and motivational factors, while sub-symbolic methods focused more on cognitive aspects, learnt knowledge, and the demographic variable of gender -- yet both largely overlooked metacognitive factors. The NSAI method, on the other hand, showed advantages by: (i) being more generalizable across both classes -- even in imbalanced datasets -- as its symbolic knowledge component compensated for the underrepresented class; and (ii) relying on a more integrated set of factors in its decision-making, including motivation, (meta)cognition, and learnt knowledge, thus offering a comprehensive and theoretically grounded interpretability framework. These contrasting findings highlight the need for a holistic comparison of AI methods before drawing conclusions based solely on predictive performance. They also underscore the potential of hybrid, human-centred NSAI methods to address the limitations of other AI families and move us closer to responsible AI for education. Specifically, by enabling stakeholders to contribute to AI design, NSAI aligns learned patterns with theoretical constructs, incorporates factors like motivation and metacognition, and strengthens the trustworthiness and responsibility of educational data mining.","authors":["Danial Hooshyar","Eve Kikas","Yeongwook Yang","Gustav \\v{S}\\'ir","Raija H\\\"am\\\"al\\\"ainen","Tommi K\\\"arkk\\\"ainen","Roger Azevedo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00615"}

The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby avoiding falling victim to hallucinations. This study (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (fixed search results) or dynamic (participant-driven searches), affect participants' perceived accuracy and confidence in evaluating LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), compared to the control condition (no search results). Findings indicate that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall confidence in their assessments than those in the static or control conditions. In addition, those higher in need for cognition (NFC) rated major hallucinations to be less accurate than low NFC participants, with no corresponding difference for genuine content or minor hallucinations. These results underscore the potential benefits of integrating web search results into LLMs for the detection of hallucinations, as well as the need for a more nuanced approach when developing human-centered systems, taking user characteristics into account.","authors":["Mahjabin Nahar","Eun-Ju Lee","Jin Won Park","Dongwon Lee"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01153"}

However, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly focus on the accuracy of final answers, often overlooking the crucial logical rigor for mathematical problem solving. The claim that state-of-the-art LLMs can solve Math Olympiad-level problems requires closer examination. To explore this, we conducted both qualitative and quantitative human evaluations of proofs generated by LLMs, and developed a schema for automatically assessing their reasoning capabilities. Our study reveals that current LLMs fall significantly short of solving challenging Olympiad-level problems and frequently fail to distinguish correct mathematical reasoning from clearly flawed solutions. Our analyses demonstrate that the occasional correct final answers provided by LLMs often result from pattern recognition or heuristic shortcuts rather than genuine mathematical reasoning.

In the benchmark, each test case comprises multiple interrelated missions. This design requires agents to dynamically adapt to evolving demands. Moreover, the proposed benchmark explores all possible mission-switching patterns within a fixed mission number. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent data generation framework to construct the benchmark.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks","abstract":"Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots.

The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API calls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By connecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources, and prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs. However, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security risks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs may be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system through various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access control, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related attacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first agentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses several agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP server's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and remediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report detailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with general-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to audit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.","authors":["Brandon Radosevich","John Halloran"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767"}

For instance, adversaries might exploit large multimodal models (LMMs) to create images that violate ethical or legal standards, while paper reviewers may misuse large language models (LLMs) to generate reviews without genuine intellectual effort. While prior work has explored detecting AI-generated images and texts, and occasionally tracing their source models, there is a lack of a systematic and fine-grained comparative study. Important dimensions--such as AI-generated images vs. text, fully vs. partially AI-generated images, and general vs. malicious use cases--remain underexplored. Furthermore, whether AI systems like GPT-4o can explain why certain forged content is attributed to specific generative models is still an open question, with no existing benchmark addressing this. To fill this gap, we introduce AI-FAKER, a comprehensive multimodal dataset with over 280,000 samples spanning multiple LLMs and LMMs, covering both general and malicious use cases for AI-generated images and texts. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (i) AI authorship detection depends not only on the generated output but also on the model's original training intent; and (ii) GPT-4o provides highly consistent but less specific explanations when analyzing content produced by OpenAI's own models, such as DALL-E and GPT-4o itself.","authors":["Hongchao Fang","Yixin Liu","Jiangshu Du","Can Qin","Ran Xu","Feng Liu","Lichao Sun","Dongwon Lee","Lifu Huang","Wenpeng Yin"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04279"}

However, existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, making it difficult to study such vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce SCAM, the largest and most diverse dataset of real-world typographic attack images to date, containing 1,162 images across hundreds of object categories and attack words. Through extensive benchmarking of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on SCAM, we demonstrate that typographic attacks significantly degrade performance, and identify that training data and model architecture influence the susceptibility to these attacks. Our findings reveal that typographic attacks persist in state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the choice of their vision encoder, though larger Large Language Models (LLMs) backbones help mitigate their vulnerability.

Until now, this framework only includes a translation of the very abstract operational semantics of CHR which, due to its abstract nature, introduces several practical issues. In this paper we present a definition of the refined operational semantics for FreeCHR and prove it to be both, a valid concretization of the very abstract semantics of FreeCHR, and an equivalent representation of the refined semantics of CHR. This will establish implementations of FreeCHR as equivalent in behavior and expressiveness to existing implementations of CHR.

In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.","authors":["Aravind Krishnan","Siva Reddy","Marius Mosbach"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05058"}

The PDPPO state transition process is divided into two steps: a deterministic step resulting in the post-decision state and a stochastic step leading to the next state. Our approach incorporates post-decision states and dual critics to reduce the problem's dimensionality and enhance the accuracy of value function estimation. Lot-sizing is a mixed integer programming problem for which we exemplify such dynamics. The objective of lot-sizing is to optimize production, delivery fulfillment, and inventory levels in uncertain demand and cost parameters. This paper evaluates the performance of PDPPO across various environments and configurations. Notably, PDPPO with a dual critic architecture achieves nearly double the maximum reward of vanilla PPO in specific scenarios, requiring fewer episode iterations and demonstrating faster and more consistent learning across different initializations. On average, PDPPO outperforms PPO in environments with a stochastic component in the state transition. These results support the benefits of using a post-decision state. Integrating this post-decision state in the value function approximation leads to more informed and efficient learning in high-dimensional and stochastic environments.","authors":["Leonardo Kanashiro Felizardo","Edoardo Fadda","Paolo Brandimarte","Emilio Del-Moral-Hernandez","Mari\\'a Cristina Vasconcelos Nascimento"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05150"}

While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a solution through low-rank updates, its static rank allocation may yield suboptimal results. Adaptive low-rank adaptation (AdaLoRA) improves this with dynamic allocation but remains sensitive to initial and target rank configurations. We introduce AROMA, a framework that automatically constructs layer-specific updates by iteratively building up rank-one components with very few trainable parameters that gradually diminish to zero. Unlike existing methods that employ rank reduction mechanisms, AROMA introduces a dual-loop architecture for rank growth. The inner loop extracts information from each rank-one subspace, while the outer loop determines the number of rank-one subspaces, i.e., the optimal rank. We reset optimizer states to maintain subspace independence.

However, direct numerical simulations with high-resolution solvers are computationally prohibitive. As an alternative, super-resolution techniques enable the enhancement of low-fidelity, low-resolution simulations. However, traditional super-resolution approaches rely on paired low-fidelity, low-resolution and high-fidelity, high-resolution datasets for training, which are often impossible to acquire in complex flow systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-step approach that eliminates the need for paired datasets. First, we perform unpaired domain translation at the low-resolution level using an Enhanced Denoising Diffusion Implicit Bridge. This process transforms low-fidelity, low-resolution inputs into high-fidelity, low-resolution outputs, and we provide a theoretical analysis to highlight the advantages of this enhanced diffusion-based approach. Second, we employ the cascaded Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement model to upscale the high-fidelity, low-resolution prediction to the high-resolution result.

Existing lane detection algorithms generally perform well under favorable weather conditions. However, their performance degrades significantly in adverse conditions, such as fog, which increases the risk of traffic accidents. This challenge is compounded by the lack of specialized datasets and methods designed for foggy environments. To address this, we introduce the FoggyLane dataset, captured in real-world foggy scenarios, and synthesize two additional datasets, FoggyCULane and FoggyTusimple, from existing popular lane detection datasets. Furthermore, we propose a robust Fog-Enhanced Network for lane detection, incorporating a Global Feature Fusion Module (GFFM) to capture global relationships in foggy images, a Kernel Feature Fusion Module (KFFM) to model the structural and positional relationships of lane instances, and a Low-level Edge Enhanced Module (LEEM) to address missing edge details in foggy conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1-scores of 95.04 on FoggyLane, 79.85 on FoggyCULane, and 96.95 on FoggyTusimple.

As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training.

This study demonstrates that through meticulous high-quality data curation and ingenious training paradigms, the compact MoE model Ling-Lite can be further trained to achieve exceptional reasoning capabilities, while maintaining its parameter-efficient architecture with only 2.75 billion activated parameters, establishing an efficient lightweight reasoning architecture. In particular, in constructing this model, we have not merely focused on enhancing advanced reasoning capabilities, exemplified by high-difficulty mathematical problem solving, but rather aimed to develop a reasoning model with more comprehensive competency coverage. Our approach ensures coverage across reasoning tasks of varying difficulty levels while preserving generic capabilities, such as instruction following, tool use, and knowledge retention. We show that, Ring-Lite-Distill's reasoning ability reaches a level comparable to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while its general capabilities significantly surpass those of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.

Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies. Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.","authors":["Daniel J.

However, previous research often merely focused on Machining Feature Recognition (MFR), falling short in effectively capturing the intricate topological and geometric characteristics of complex geometry features. In this paper, we propose BRepFormer, a novel transformer-based model to recognize both machining feature and complex CAD models' features. BRepFormer encodes and fuses the geometric and topological features of the models. Afterwards, BRepFormer utilizes a transformer architecture for feature propagation and a recognition head to identify geometry features. During each iteration of the transformer, we incorporate a bias that combines edge features and topology features to reinforce geometric constraints on each face. In addition, we also proposed a dataset named Complex B-rep Feature Dataset (CBF), comprising 20,000 B-rep models. By covering more complex B-rep models, it is better aligned with industrial applications. The experimental results demonstrate that BRepFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and our CBF datasets.","authors":["Yongkang Dai","Xiaoshui Huang","Yunpeng Bai","Hao Guo","Hongping Gan","Ling Yang","Yilei Shi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07378"}

Not all malware and not all LLMs are equivalent but the study shows excellent results with Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet. Despite a few errors, the quality of analysis is overall equal or better than without AI assistance. For good results, the AI cannot operate alone and must constantly be guided by an experienced analyst. The gain of speed is largely visible with AI assistance, even when taking account the time to understand AI's hallucinations, exaggerations and omissions. The cost is usually noticeably lower than the salary of a malware analyst, but attention and guidance is needed to keep it under control in cases where the AI would naturally loop without showing progress.","authors":["Axelle Apvrille","Daniel Nakov"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07574"}

Evaluating Paragraph-level MT with Question Answering","abstract":"Despite the steady progress in machine translation evaluation, existing automatic metrics struggle to capture how well meaning is preserved beyond sentence boundaries. We posit that reliance on a single intrinsic quality score, trained to mimic human judgments, might be insufficient for evaluating translations of long, complex passages, and a more ``pragmatic'' approach that assesses how accurately key information is conveyed by a translation in context is needed. We introduce TREQA (Translation Evaluation via Question-Answering), a framework that extrinsically evaluates translation quality by assessing how accurately candidate translations answer reading comprehension questions that target key information in the original source or reference texts. In challenging domains that require long-range understanding, such as literary texts, we show that TREQA is competitive with and, in some cases, outperforms state-of-the-art neural and LLM-based metrics in ranking alternative paragraph-level translations, despite never being explicitly optimized to correlate with human judgments. Furthermore, the generated questions and answers offer interpretability: empirical analysis shows that they effectively target translation errors identified by experts in evaluated datasets.

Identifying EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells in Multi-chain Reuse Contracts","abstract":"As the development of Solidity contracts on Ethereum, more developers are reusing them on other compatible blockchains. However, developers may overlook the differences between the designs of the blockchain system, such as the Gas Mechanism and Consensus Protocol, leading to the same contracts on different blockchains not being able to achieve consistent execution as on Ethereum. This inconsistency reveals design flaws in reused contracts, exposing code smells that hinder code reusability, and we define this inconsistency as EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to reveal the causes and characteristics of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. To ensure the identified smells reflect real developer concerns, we collected and analyzed 1,379 security audit reports and 326 Stack Overflow posts related to reused contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon. Using the open card sorting method, we defined six types of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. For automated detection, we developed a tool named EquivGuard. It employs static taint analysis to identify key paths from different patterns and uses symbolic execution to verify path reachability. Our analysis of 905,948 contracts across six major blockchains shows that EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells are widespread, with an average prevalence of 17.70%. While contracts with code smells do not necessarily lead to financial loss and attacks, their high prevalence and significant asset management underscore the potential threats of reusing these smelly Ethereum contracts. Thus, developers are advised to abandon Copy-and-Paste programming practices and detect EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells before reusing Ethereum contracts.","authors":["Zexu Wang","Jiachi Chen","Tao Zhang","Yu Zhang","Weizhe Zhang","Yuming Feng","Zibin Zheng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07589"}
{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Boosting Universal LLM Reward Design through Heuristic Reward Observation Space Evolution","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.

Specifically, we consider a setting where data is collected sequentially from a linear system subject to exogenous process noise, and is then used to refine estimates of the optimal control policy. We integrate recursive least squares (RLS) for online model estimation within a certainty-equivalent framework, and employ PI to iteratively update the control policy. In this work, we investigate first the convergence behavior of RLS under two different models of adversarial noise, namely point-wise and energy bounded noise, and then we provide a closed-loop analysis of the combined model identification and control design process. This iterative scheme is formulated as an algorithmic dynamical system consisting of the feedback interconnection between two algorithms expressed as discrete-time systems. This system theoretic viewpoint on indirect data-driven control allows us to establish convergence guarantees to the optimal controller in the face of uncertainty caused by noisy data.

Despite its critical role in facilitating interaction within the DHH population, significant barriers persist due to the limited fluency in sign language among the hearing population. Overcoming this communication gap through automatic sign language recognition (SLR) remains a challenge, particularly at a dynamic word-level, where temporal and spatial dependencies must be effectively recognized. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown potential in SLR, they are computationally intensive and have difficulties in capturing global temporal dependencies between video sequences. To address these limitations, we propose a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT) model for word-level American Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Transformer models make use of self-attention mechanisms to effectively capture global relationships across spatial and temporal dimensions, which makes them suitable for complex gesture recognition tasks. The VideoMAE model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 75.58% on the WLASL100 dataset, highlighting its strong performance compared to traditional CNNs with 65.89%. Our study demonstrates that transformer-based architectures have great potential to advance SLR, overcome communication barriers and promote the inclusion of DHH individuals.","authors":["Alexander Brettmann","Jakob Gr\\\"avinghoff","Marlene R\\\"uschoff","Marie Westhues"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07792"}

In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \\emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding.

Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models.

Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those trained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows for models that learn modality-specific weights, significantly enhancing performance.","authors":["Mustafa Shukor","Enrico Fini","Victor Guilherme Turrisi da Costa","Matthieu Cord","Joshua Susskind","Alaaeldin El-Nouby"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07951"}

A remedy is regularizing the $f$-divergence by a squared maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) associated with a characteristic kernel $K$. We use the kernel mean embedding to show that this regularization can be rewritten as the Moreau envelope of some function on the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Then, we exploit well-known results on Moreau envelopes in Hilbert spaces to analyze the MMD-regularized $f$-divergences, particularly their gradients. Subsequently, we use our findings to analyze Wasserstein gradient flows of MMD-regularized $f$-divergences. We provide proof-of-the-concept numerical examples for flows starting from empirical measures. Here, we cover $f$-divergences with infinite and finite recession constants. Lastly, we extend our results to the tight variational formulation of $f$-divergences and numerically compare the resulting flows.","authors":["Viktor Stein","Sebastian Neumayer","Nicolaj Rux","Gabriele Steidl"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04613"}

In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.","authors":["Will Dorrell","Kyle Hsu","Luke Hollingsworth","Jin Hwa Lee","Jiajun Wu","Chelsea Finn","Peter E Latham","Tim EJ Behrens","James CR Whittington"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06232"}

In particular, we derive all the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second-moment operators for these structured random circuits under a solvable condition, by establishing a link to the Kitaev chain, and show that their spectral gaps can exceed those of Haar random circuits. Our findings have applications in improving circuit depth bounds for randomized benchmarking and the generation of approximate unitary 2-designs from shallow random circuits.","authors":["Ryotaro Suzuki","Hosho Katsura","Yosuke Mitsuhashi","Tomohiro Soejima","Jens Eisert","Nobuyuki Yoshioka"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24127"}

Whether $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$ and $\\mathsf{QMA}$ are equal is still a major open problem. It is not even known whether $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$ has a universal gateset; Solovay-Kitaev does not apply due to perfect completeness. Hence, we do not generally know whether $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^G=\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G'}$ (superscript denoting gateset), given two universal gatesets $G,G'$. In this paper, we make progress towards the gateset question by proving that for all $k\\in\\mathbb N$, the gateset $G_{2^k}$ (Amy et al., RC 2024) is universal for all gatesets in the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{2^k}),\\zeta_{2^k}=e^{2\\pi i/2^k}$, i.e. $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^G\\subseteq\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all gatesets $G$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{2^k})$. For $\\mathsf{BQP}_1$, we can even show that $G_2$ suffices for all $2^k$-th cyclotomic fields. We exhibit complete problems for all $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$: Quantum $l$-SAT in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{2^k})$ is complete for $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all $l\\ge4$, and $l=3$ if $k\\ge3$, where quantum $l$-SAT is the problem of deciding whether a set of $l$-local Hamiltonians has a common ground state. Additionally, we give the first $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete $2$-local Hamiltonian problem: It is $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$-complete (for $k\\ge3$) to decide whether a given $2$-local Hamiltonian $H$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{2^k})$ has a nonempty nullspace. Our techniques also extend to sparse Hamiltonians, and so we can prove the first $\\mathsf{QMA}_1(2)$-complete (i.e. $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$ with two unentangled provers) Hamiltonian problem. Finally, we prove that the Gapped Clique Homology problem defined by King and Kohler (FOCS 2024) is $\\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_2}$-complete, and the Clique Homology problem without promise gap is PSPACE-complete.","authors":["Dorian Rudolph"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02681"}

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Microfoundation Inference for Strategic Prediction","abstract":"Often in prediction tasks, the predictive model itself can influence the distribution of the target variable, a phenomenon termed performative prediction. Generally, this influence stems from strategic actions taken by stakeholders with a vested interest in predictive models. A key challenge that hinders the widespread adaptation of performative prediction in machine learning is that practitioners are generally unaware of the social impacts of their predictions. To address this gap, we propose a methodology for learning the distribution map that encapsulates the long-term impacts of predictive models on the population. Specifically, we model agents' responses as a cost-adjusted utility maximization problem and propose estimates for said cost. Our approach leverages optimal transport to align pre-model exposure (ex ante) and post-model exposure (ex post) distributions. We provide a rate of convergence for this proposed estimate and assess its quality through empirical demonstrations on a credit-scoring dataset.","authors":["Daniele Bracale","Subha Maity","Felipe Maia Polo","Seamus Somerstep","Moulinath Banerjee","Yuekai Sun"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08998"}

To mitigate these limitations, D-Wave Systems developed a mechanism called Reverse Annealing, a specific type of quantum annealing designed to perform local refinement of good states found elsewhere. Despite the research activity around Reverse Annealing, none has theorized about the possible benefits related to the transfer of knowledge under this paradigm. This work moves in that direction and is driven by experimentation focused on answering two key research questions: i) is reverse annealing a paradigm that can benefit from knowledge transfer between similar problems? and ii) can we infer the characteristics that an input solution should meet to help increase the probability of success? To properly guide the tests in this paper, the well-known Knapsack Problem has been chosen for benchmarking purposes, using a total of 34 instances composed of 14 and 16 items.","authors":["Eneko Osaba","Esther Villar-Rodriguez"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15865"}

Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) enables high-resolution retinal imaging, but automated segmentation performance varies, especially in cases with complex fluid and hyperreflective foci (HRF) patterns. This study proposes an active-learning-based deep learning pipeline for automated segmentation of retinal layers, fluid, and HRF, using four state-of-the-art models: U-Net, SegFormer, SwinUNETR, and VM-UNet, trained on expert-annotated SD-OCT volumes. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation, and retinal thickness was quantified using a K-nearest neighbors algorithm and visualized with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) maps. SwinUNETR achieved the highest overall accuracy (DSC = 0.7719; NSD = 0.8149), while VM-UNet excelled in specific layers. Structural differences were observed between non-proliferative and proliferative DR, with layer-specific thickening correlating with visual acuity impairment. The proposed framework enables robust, clinically relevant DR assessment while reducing the need for manual annotation, supporting improved disease monitoring and treatment planning.","authors":["S.

{"created":"2025-04-14","title":"Quantum Error Detection For Early Term Fault-Tolerant Quantum Algorithms","abstract":"Quantum error detection (QED) offers a promising pathway to fault tolerance in near-term quantum devices by balancing error suppression with minimal resource overhead. However, its practical utility hinges on optimizing design parameters-such as syndrome measurement frequency-to avoid diminishing returns from detection overhead. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for fault-tolerant compilation and simulation of quantum algorithms using [[n, n-2, 2]] codes, which enable low-qubit-overhead error detection and a simple nearly fault-tolerant universal set of operations. We demonstrate and analyze our pipeline with a purely statistical interpretation and through the implementation of Grover's search algorithm. Our results are used to answer the question is quantum error detection a worthwhile avenue for early-term fault tolerance, and if so how can we get the most out of it? Simulations under the circuit-level noise model reveal that finding optimal syndrome schedules improves algorithm success probabilities by an average of 6.7x but eventual statistical limits from post-selection in noisy/resource-limited regimes constrain scalability. Furthermore, we propose a simple data-driven approach to predict fault tolerant compilation parameters, such as optimal syndrome schedules, and expected fault tolerant performance gains based on circuit and noise features. These results provide actionable guidelines for implementing QED in early-term quantum experiments and underscore its role as a pragmatic, constant-overhead error mitigation layer for shallow algorithms.

These classes are essential in obstruction theory, embedding problems, and cobordism theory. In this work, we first reestablish an appropriate notion of vector bundles in a persistent setting, allowing characteristic classes to be interpreted through topological data analysis. Next, we propose a concrete algorithm to compute persistent cohomology classes that represent the Stiefel-Whitney classes of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold. Given a point cloud, we construct a \\v{C}ech or alpha filtration. By applying the Wu formula in this setting, we derive a sequence of persistent cohomology classes from the filtration. We show that if the filtration is homotopy equivalent to a smooth manifold, then one of these persistent cohomology classes corresponds to the $k$-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle of that manifold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on real-world datasets, including applications to complex manifolds, image patches, and molecular conformation space.","authors":["Dongwoo Gang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15854"}

However, these classical approaches often require a large number of parameters to achieve reasonable accuracy, particularly for complex PDEs. In this paper, we present a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) that combines quantum and classical components, allowing us to solve PDEs with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and convergence to classical PINNs. We systematically evaluated two quantum circuit architectures across various configurations on five benchmark PDEs to identify optimal QCPINN designs. Our results demonstrate that the QCPINN achieves stable convergence and comparable accuracy, while requiring approximately 10% of the trainable parameters used in classical approaches. It also results in a 40% reduction in the relative error L2 for the convection-diffusion equation. These findings demonstrate the potential of parameter efficiency as a measurable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning, significantly reducing model complexity while preserving solution quality.
