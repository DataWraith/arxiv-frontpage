While qualitative inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and questions.

Scholars suggest that OEE requires an \"open\" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously \"in the wild,\" achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether \"open\" ALife systems \"in-the-wild,\" based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.","authors":["Botao Amber Hu","Helena Rong"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236"}

With these models being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders. However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization. Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms.

By transforming concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999 across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength, providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time predictions using standard laboratory parameters.

We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.

With climate change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem, especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general, as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively unexplored dataset.

A key limitation of existing adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy, and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy.

Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.

This paper explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings.

To address this gap, we introduce the $\\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple images. MMRB comprises $\\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by GPT-4o and refined by human experts.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"SF$^2$Bench: Evaluating Data-Driven Models for Compound Flood Forecasting in South Florida","abstract":"Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors. Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.","authors":["Xu Zheng","Chaohao Lin","Sipeng Chen","Zhuomin Chen","Jimeng Shi","Wei Cheng","Jayantha Obeysekera","Jason Liu","Dongsheng Luo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04281"}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However, existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability. Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g., monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.","authors":["Runxiang Wang","Boxiao Wang","Kai Li","Yifan Zhang","Jian Cheng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04282"}

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner.

For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked. In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as \"memristors\" (nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric. Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.","authors":["Stephen Smith","Cormac Purcell","Zdenka Kuncic"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04285"}

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback","abstract":"Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment. Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.","authors":["Yongjin Yang","Sinjae Kang","Juyong Lee","Dongjun Lee","Se-Young Yun","Kimin Lee"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287"}

First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm to implement this approach.

In this work, we investigate how transformers perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature, \\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs (e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively. Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \\textit{symbolic distance} and \\textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.","authors":["Jesse Geerts","Stephanie Chan","Claudia Clopath","Kimberly Stachenfeld"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289"}

This has compelled regulators to impose stringent controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods, GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing fraud detection.","authors":["Bruno Deprez","Bart Baesens","Tim Verdonck","Wouter Verbeke"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292"}

In response, the study begins with a survey of the three principal proof systems that is, David Hilbert's axiomatic systems and Gerhard Gentzen's natural deduction and his sequent calculus, thus situating logical inferentialism within a broader proof-theoretic landscape. The investigation then turns to the core tenets of logical inferentialism by focusing on the role of introduction and elimination rules in determining the meaning of logical constants. Through this framework, natural deduction is evaluated as a system that satisfies key inferentialist virtues including harmony, conservativeness and the subformula property. Ultimately, the paper presents challenges to classical logic from intuitionist and revisionist perspectives by arguing that certain classical principles fail to uphold inferentialist standards, consequently undermining their legitimacy within a meaning-theoretic framework.","authors":["Khashayar Irani"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04295"}

We evaluate two architectures: an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall, historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance forecast robustness and adaptability.

The first process is anatomical in nature: the target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble evaluation.","authors":["Abdourrahmane Mahamane Atto (LISTIC)"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04297"}

This paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability crisis.

In AI and Machine Learning (ML), such environments correlate with higher standards of responsible development. Without transparency, disparities, microaggressions and misconduct will remain unaddressed, undermining the very structural inequities responsible AI aims to mitigate. While prior work investigates workplace transparency and disparities in broad domains (e.g. science and technology, law) for specific demographic subgroups, it lacks in-depth and intersectional conclusions and a focus on the AI/ML community. To address this, we conducted a pilot survey of 1260 AI/ML professionals both in industry and academia across different axes, probing aspects such as belonging, performance, workplace Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, accessibility, performance and compensation, microaggressions, misconduct, growth, and well-being.

Of course, the process of creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO), indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters, which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring boundedness of the identified optima.

Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality. We will make the code and dataset available.","authors":["Maksym Ivashechkin","Oscar Mendez","Richard Bowden"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04351"}

A half unit is composed of two stages: First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.","authors":["Ethem Alpaydin"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04352"}

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns.

In particular, some obstacles are only traversable from some orientations. However, learning this interaction by encoding the angle of approach as a model input demands a large and diverse training dataset and is computationally inefficient during planning due to repeated model inference. To address these challenges, we present SPARTA, a method for estimating approach angle conditioned traversability from point clouds. Specifically, we impose geometric structure into our network by outputting a smooth analytical function over the 1-Sphere that predicts risk distribution for any angle of approach with minimal overhead and can be reused for subsequent queries. The function is composed of Fourier basis functions, which has important advantages for generalization due to their periodic nature and smoothness. We demonstrate SPARTA both in a high-fidelity simulation platform, where our model achieves a 91\\% success rate crossing a 40m boulder field (compared to 73\\% for the baseline), and on hardware, illustrating the generalization ability of the model to real-world settings.","authors":["Zihao Dong","Alan Papalia","Leonard Jung","Alenna Spiro","Philip R.

AI agents need to have such a world model for action planning as well. It is not clear how current AI models, especially generative models, are able to learn such world models and carry out procedural planning in diverse environments. We introduce WorldPrediction, a video-based benchmark for evaluating world modeling and procedural planning capabilities of different AI models. In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus primarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning, WorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal and semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to distinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered sequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual distractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different types of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across different hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual observations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity cues in background scenes, we provide \"action equivalents\" - identical actions observed in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is grounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring better reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human filtering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models barely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP whereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly.","authors":["Delong Chen","Willy Chung","Yejin Bang","Ziwei Ji","Pascale Fung"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04363"}

We systematically study how three different variables in training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers (which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for new languages.","authors":["Zheng-Xin Yong","Vineel Pratap","Michael Auli","Jean Maillard"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364"}

Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of 12.2\\% and RSLE average precision of 25\\%.

In Bangladesh, Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) serves as the primary mode of communication for many individuals with hearing impairments. This study fine-tunes state-of-the-art video transformer architectures -- VideoMAE, ViViT, and TimeSformer -- on BdSLW60 (arXiv:2402.08635), a small-scale BdSL dataset with 60 frequent signs. We standardized the videos to 30 FPS, resulting in 9,307 user trial clips. To evaluate scalability and robustness, the models were also fine-tuned on BdSLW401 (arXiv:2503.02360), a large-scale dataset with 401 sign classes. Additionally, we benchmark performance against public datasets, including LSA64 and WLASL. Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, horizontal flipping, and short-side scaling were applied to improve model robustness. To ensure balanced evaluation across folds during model selection, we employed 10-fold stratified cross-validation on the training set, while signer-independent evaluation was carried out using held-out test data from unseen users U4 and U8. Results show that video transformer models significantly outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. Performance is influenced by factors such as dataset size, video quality, frame distribution, frame rate, and model architecture. Among the models, the VideoMAE variant (MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics) achieved the highest accuracies of 95.5% on the frame rate corrected BdSLW60 dataset and 81.04% on the front-facing signs of BdSLW401 -- demonstrating strong potential for scalable and accurate BdSL recognition.","authors":["Jubayer Ahmed Bhuiyan Shawon","Hasan Mahmud","Kamrul Hasan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04367"}

While we can compare these embeddings using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations, and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies, we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.","authors":["Matthieu Tehenan","Vikram Natarajan","Jonathan Michala","Milton Lin","Juri Opitz"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373"}

In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called the \"Rayleigh quotient\" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective, Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous eigenvalue problems.","authors":["Conor Rowan","John Evans","Kurt Maute","Alireza Doostan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04375"}

A critical challenge for continual learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay samples and the relationship between tasks.","authors":["Yasaman Mahdaviyeh","James Lucas","Mengye Ren","Andreas S.

Although DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models, our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.","authors":["Matthew W.

In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories generated via contractive affine maps over $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively, achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on algebraic hardness assumptions.","authors":["Mohamed Aly Bouke"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04383"}

In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.","authors":["Qiuyu Tang","Bonor Ayambem","Mooi Choo Chuah","Aparna Bharati"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Bridging the Performance Gap Between Target-Free and Target-Based Reinforcement Learning With Iterated Q-Learning","abstract":"In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates, and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings. Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale reinforcement learning research.","authors":["Th\\'eo Vincent","Yogesh Tripathi","Tim Faust","Yaniv Oren","Jan Peters","Carlo D'Eramo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04398"}

Tailored for settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.","authors":["Suzan Ece Ada","Emre Ugur"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04399"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Normalize Filters! Classical Wisdom for Deep Vision","abstract":"Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.","authors":["Gustavo Perez","Stella X.

Recent evidence suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However, it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However, human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning. These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in human language learners.","authors":["Wesley Scivetti","Tatsuya Aoyama","Ethan Wilcox","Nathan Schneider"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408"}

While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task (chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making near-term progress.","authors":["Peter Jansen","Samiah Hassan","Ruoyao Wang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410"}

This class of equations exhibits hyperbolic behavior in degenerate regions and parabolic behavior in non-degenerate regions, resulting in sharp wave fronts in the solution profiles and a parabolic-type time-step restriction, $\\tau \\sim O(h^2)$, for explicit time integration. To address these challenges and solve such equations in complex domains, we employ DG methods with appropriate stabilizing limiters on unstructured meshes to capture the wave fronts and use ETD-RK methods for time integration to resolve the stiffness of parabolic terms. We extract the system's stiffness using the Jacobian matrix of the DG discretization for diffusion terms and adopt a nodal formulation to facilitate its computation. The algorithm is described in detail for two-dimensional triangular meshes. We also conduct a linear stability analysis in one spatial dimension and present computational results on three-dimensional simplex meshes, demonstrating significant improvements in stability and large time-step sizes.","authors":["Ziyao Xu","Yong-Tao Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04416"}

We propose hunk divergence, a metric that quantifies the variation among edits in a patch by capturing lexical, structural, and file-level differences, while incorporating the number of hunks involved. We further define spatial proximity, a classification that models how hunks are spatially distributed across the program hierarchy. Our empirical study spanning six LLMs reveals that model success rates decline with increased divergence and spatial dispersion. Notably, when using the LLM alone, no model succeeds in the most dispersed Fragment class.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"A Framework for Auditing Chatbots for Dialect-Based Quality-of-Service Harms","abstract":"Increasingly, individuals who engage in online activities are expected to interact with large language model (LLM)-based chatbots. Prior work has shown that LLMs can display dialect bias, which occurs when they produce harmful responses when prompted with text written in minoritized dialects. However, whether and how this bias propagates to systems built on top of LLMs, such as chatbots, is still unclear. We conduct a review of existing approaches for auditing LLMs for dialect bias and show that they cannot be straightforwardly adapted to audit LLM-based chatbots due to issues of substantive and ecological validity. To address this, we present a framework for auditing LLM-based chatbots for dialect bias by measuring the extent to which they produce quality-of-service harms, which occur when systems do not work equally well for different people. Our framework has three key characteristics that make it useful in practice. First, by leveraging dynamically generated instead of pre-existing text, our framework enables testing over any dialect, facilitates multi-turn conversations, and represents how users are likely to interact with chatbots in the real world. Second, by measuring quality-of-service harms, our framework aligns audit results with the real-world outcomes of chatbot use. Third, our framework requires only query access to an LLM-based chatbot, meaning that it can be leveraged equally effectively by internal auditors, external auditors, and even individual users in order to promote accountability. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework, we conduct a case study audit of Amazon Rufus, a widely-used LLM-based chatbot in the customer service domain. Our results reveal that Rufus produces lower-quality responses to prompts written in minoritized English dialects, and that these quality-of-service harms are exacerbated by the presence of typos in prompts.","authors":["Emma Harvey","Rene F.

In this paper, we analyze the API's behavior by running identical queries across a period of 12 weeks. Our findings suggest that the search endpoint returns highly inconsistent results between queries in ways that are not officially documented. Specifically, the API seems to randomize returned videos based on the relative popularity of the respective topic during the query period, making it nearly impossible to obtain representative historical video samples, especially during non-peak topical periods. Our results also suggest that the API may prioritize shorter, more popular videos, although the role of channel popularity is not as clear.

This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality metric $\\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing metrics detect only the first two.

This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera.

Loss asymmetry drives a model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties, however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking. Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs).","authors":["Gil I.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Learning to Diagnose Privately: DP-Powered LLMs for Radiology Report Classification","abstract":"Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively. Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.","authors":["Payel Bhattacharjee","Fengwei Tian","Ravi Tandon","Joseph Lo","Heidi Hanson","Geoffrey Rubin","Nirav Merchant","John Gounley"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04450"}

This yields a sequence of nonlinear problems to be solved for the stages of the Runge--Kutta method. The resulting nonlinear system of differential equations is discretized using a finite element method. To compute a numerical approximation of the stages at each time step, we employ Newton's method, which requires the solution of a large and sparse generalized saddle-point problem at each nonlinear iteration. We devise an augmented Lagrangian preconditioner within the flexible GMRES method for solving the Newton systems at each time step. The preconditioner can be applied inexactly with the help of a multigrid routine. We present numerical evidence of the robustness and efficiency of the proposed strategy for different values of the viscosity, mesh size, time step, and number of stages of the Runge--Kutta method.","authors":["Santolo Leveque","Yunhui He","Maxim Olshanskii"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04451"}

In this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy) and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate. While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples (approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on both datasets.","authors":["Huynh T. T.

To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing. Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains, showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method.

However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable, domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct.

Despite these benefits, code review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.","authors":["Oussama Ben Sghaier","Rosalia Tufano","Gabriele Bavota","Houari Sahraoui"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04464"}

Specifically, the P-6DMA enables polarforming by adaptively tuning the antenna's polarization electrically as well as controls the antenna's rotation mechanically, thereby exploiting both polarization and spatial diversity to reconfigure wireless channels for improving communication performance. First, we model the P-6DMA channel in terms of transceiver antenna polarforming vectors and antenna rotations. We then propose a new two-timescale transmission protocol to maximize the weighted sum-rate for a P-6DMA-enhanced multiuser system. Specifically, antenna rotations at the base station (BS) are first optimized based on the statistical channel state information (CSI) of all users, which varies at a much slower rate compared to their instantaneous CSI. Then, transceiver polarforming vectors are designed to cater to the instantaneous CSI under the optimized BS antennas' rotations. Under the polarforming phase shift and amplitude constraints, a new polarforming and rotation joint design problem is efficiently addressed by a low-complexity algorithm based on penalty dual decomposition, where the polarforming coefficients are updated in parallel to reduce computational time. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance advantages of polarforming, antenna rotation, and their joint design in comparison with various benchmarks without polarforming or antenna rotation adaptation.","authors":["Xiaodan Shao","Qijun Jiang","Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","Naofal Al-Dhahir"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04471"}

The dataset, characterized by high missing values (38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics (TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models, including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest (93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated, with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP, CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact.

As tasks grow more complex, achieving high performance requires not only technical proficiency but also strong interpersonal skills that allow individuals to coordinate effectively within teams. While prior research has identified social skills and familiarity as key drivers of team success, their joint effects -- particularly in temporary teams -- remain underexplored due to data and methodological constraints. To address this gap, we analyze a large-scale panel dataset from the real-time strategy game Age of Empires II, where players are assigned quasi-randomly to temporary teams and must coordinate under dynamic, high-pressure conditions. We isolate individual contributions by comparing observed match outcomes with predictions based on task proficiency. Our findings confirm a robust 'team player effect': certain individuals consistently improve team outcomes beyond what their technical skills predict. This effect is significantly amplified by team familiarity -- teams with prior shared experience benefit more from the presence of such individuals. Moreover, the effect grows with team size, suggesting that social skills become increasingly valuable as coordination demands rise. Our results demonstrate that social skills and familiarity interact in a complementary, rather than additive, way. These findings contribute to the literature on team performance by documenting the strength and structure of the team player effect in a quasi-randomized, high-stakes setting, with implications for teamwork in organizations and labor markets.","authors":["Nico Elbert","Alicia von Schenk","Fabian Kosse","Victor Klockmann","Nikolai Stein","Christoph Flath"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04475"}

Ideally, a face recognition system should perform well across different head poses, which is known as pose-invariant face recognition. To achieve pose invariance, current approaches rely on sophisticated methods, such as face frontalization and various facial feature extraction model architectures. However, these methods are somewhat impractical in real-life settings and are typically evaluated on small scientific datasets, such as Multi-PIE. In this work, we propose the inverse method of face frontalization, called face defrontalization, to augment the training dataset of facial feature extraction model. The method does not introduce any time overhead during the inference step. The method is composed of: 1) training an adapted face defrontalization FFWM model on a frontal-profile pairs dataset, which has been preprocessed using our proposed face alignment method; 2) training a ResNet-50 facial feature extraction model based on ArcFace loss on a raw and randomly defrontalized large-scale dataset, where defrontalization was performed with our previously trained face defrontalization model. Our method was compared with the existing approaches on four open-access datasets: LFW, AgeDB, CFP, and Multi-PIE. Defrontalization shows improved results compared to models without defrontalization, while the proposed adjustments show clear superiority over the state-of-the-art face frontalization FFWM method on three larger open-access datasets, but not on the small Multi-PIE dataset for extreme poses (75 and 90 degrees).

In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly approach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D point cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a 1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then processed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel convolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides sufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and introduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features. Furthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit grouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and takes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are friendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily deploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D detection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves competitive performance.

Such constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.","authors":["Aladin Djuhera","Amin Seffo","Masataro Asai","Holger Boche"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04500"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"AuthGuard: Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Language Guidance","abstract":"Existing deepfake detection techniques struggle to keep-up with the ever-evolving novel, unseen forgeries methods. This limitation stems from their reliance on statistical artifacts learned during training, which are often tied to specific generation processes that may not be representative of samples from new, unseen deepfake generation methods encountered at test time. We propose that incorporating language guidance can improve deepfake detection generalization by integrating human-like commonsense reasoning -- such as recognizing logical inconsistencies and perceptual anomalies -- alongside statistical cues. To achieve this, we train an expert deepfake vision encoder by combining discriminative classification with image-text contrastive learning, where the text is generated by generalist MLLMs using few-shot prompting. This allows the encoder to extract both language-describable, commonsense deepfake artifacts and statistical forgery artifacts from pixel-level distributions. To further enhance robustness, we integrate data uncertainty learning into vision-language contrastive learning, mitigating noise in image-text supervision. Our expert vision encoder seamlessly interfaces with an LLM, further enabling more generalized and interpretable deepfake detection while also boosting accuracy. The resulting framework, AuthGuard, achieves state-of-the-art deepfake detection accuracy in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, achieving AUC gains of 6.15% on the DFDC dataset and 16.68% on the DF40 dataset. Additionally, AuthGuard significantly enhances deepfake reasoning, improving performance by 24.69% on the DDVQA dataset.","authors":["Guangyu Shen","Zhihua Li","Xiang Xu","Tianchen Zhao","Zheng Zhang","Dongsheng An","Zhuowen Tu","Yifan Xing","Qin Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04501"}

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Pruning Everything, Everywhere, All at Once","abstract":"Deep learning stands as the modern paradigm for solving cognitive tasks. However, as the problem complexity increases, models grow deeper and computationally prohibitive, hindering advancements in real-world and resource-constrained applications. Extensive studies reveal that pruning structures in these models efficiently reduces model complexity and improves computational efficiency. Successful strategies in this sphere include removing neurons (i.e., filters, heads) or layers, but not both together. Therefore, simultaneously pruning different structures remains an open problem. To fill this gap and leverage the benefits of eliminating neurons and layers at once, we propose a new method capable of pruning different structures within a model as follows. Given two candidate subnetworks (pruned models), one from layer pruning and the other from neuron pruning, our method decides which to choose by selecting the one with the highest representation similarity to its parent (the network that generates the subnetworks) using the Centered Kernel Alignment metric. Iteratively repeating this process provides highly sparse models that preserve the original predictive ability. Throughout extensive experiments on standard architectures and benchmarks, we confirm the effectiveness of our approach and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art layer and filter pruning techniques. At high levels of Floating Point Operations reduction, most state-of-the-art methods degrade accuracy, whereas our approach either improves it or experiences only a minimal drop. Notably, on the popular ResNet56 and ResNet110, we achieve a milestone of 86.37% and 95.82% FLOPs reduction. Besides, our pruned models obtain robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples and take an important step towards GreenAI, reducing carbon emissions by up to 83.31%.

In this paper, we introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision.

On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to \"boost\" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting with them.","authors":["Ekaterina Fedorova","Madeline Kitch","Chara Podimata"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525"}

However, due to limited energy and low-resolution imaging, smart terminal devices struggle to maintain real-time monitoring performance. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-stage detection approach for road crack detection, EECD-Net, to enhance accuracy and energy efficiency of instrumentation. Specifically, the sophisticated Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) is employed to address the inherent challenges of low-quality images, which effectively enhance image resolution while preserving critical structural details. Meanwhile, a Spike Convolution Unit (SCU) with Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) neurons is proposed to convert these images into sparse pulse sequences, significantly reducing power consumption. Additionally, a Gated Attention Transformer (GAT) module is designed to strategically fuse multi-scale feature representations through adaptive attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and intricate local crack patterns, and significantly enhancing detection robustness across varying crack morphologies. The experiments on the CrackVision12K benchmark demonstrate that EECD-Net achieves a remarkable 98.6\\% detection accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art counterparts such as Hybrid-Segmentor by a significant 1.5\\%. Notably, the EECD-Net maintains exceptional energy efficiency, consuming merely 5.6 mJ, which is a substantial 33\\% reduction compared to baseline implementations.

We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous training.

However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial variability and achieve a $4200\\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.","authors":["Luca Ghafourpour","Valentin Duruisseaux","Bahareh Tolooshams","Philip H.

Our proposed approach is efficient and adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment. Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed algorithm.

While simulation frameworks can generate synthetic data to address these gaps, existing methods fail to replicate behavioural diversity, limiting their effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Personality-driven User Behaviour Simulator (PUB), an LLM-based simulation framework that integrates the Big Five personality traits to model personalised user behaviour. PUB dynamically infers user personality from behavioural logs (e.g., ratings, reviews) and item metadata, then generates synthetic interactions that preserve statistical fidelity to real-world data. Experiments on the Amazon review datasets show that logs generated by PUB closely align with real user behaviour and reveal meaningful associations between personality traits and recommendation outcomes. These results highlight the potential of the personality-driven simulator to advance recommender system evaluation, offering scalable, controllable, high-fidelity alternatives to resource-intensive real-world experiments.","authors":["Chenglong Ma","Ziqi Xu","Yongli Ren","Danula Hettiachchi","Jeffrey Chan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04551"}

In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play module called Learnable Separable Kernels (LSKs), which are formally rank-one matrices designed to directly enhance image frequency components. We begin by explaining why LSKs are particularly suitable for SISR tasks from a frequency perspective. Baseline methods incorporating LSKs demonstrate a significant reduction of over 60\\% in both the number of parameters and computational requirements. This reduction is achieved through the decomposition of LSKs into orthogonal and mergeable one-dimensional kernels. Additionally, we perform an interpretable analysis of the feature maps generated by LSKs. Visualization results reveal the capability of LSKs to enhance image frequency components effectively. Extensive experiments show that incorporating LSKs not only reduces the number of parameters and computational load but also improves overall model performance. Moreover, these experiments demonstrate that models utilizing LSKs exhibit superior performance, particularly as the upscaling factor increases.","authors":["Heng Tian"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04555"}

The perturbation detection module utilizes the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one. Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder stealing attacks by up to 24.63\\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and combinations of multiple defenses.","authors":["Xuhao Ren","Haotian Liang","Yajie Wang","Chuan Zhang","Zehui Xiong","Liehuang Zhu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04556"}

While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues, they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13 African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude.

However, extending such capabilities to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the high cost of retraining vision-language alignments when upgrading the underlying reasoner LLMs. A straightforward solution is to decouple perception from reasoning, i.e., converting visual inputs into language representations (e.g., captions) that are then passed to a powerful text-only reasoner. However, this decoupling introduces a critical challenge: the visual extractor must generate descriptions that are both faithful to the image and informative enough to support accurate downstream reasoning. To address this, we propose Reasoning-Aligned Perceptual Decoupling via Caption Reward Optimization (RACRO) - a reasoning-guided reinforcement learning strategy that aligns the extractor's captioning behavior with the reasoning objective. By closing the perception-reasoning loop via reward-based optimization, RACRO significantly enhances visual grounding and extracts reasoning-optimized representations. Experiments on multi-modal math and science benchmarks show that the proposed RACRO method achieves state-of-the-art average performance while enabling superior scalability and plug-and-play adaptation to more advanced reasoning LLMs without the necessity for costly multi-modal re-alignment.","authors":["Yunhao Gou","Kai Chen","Zhili Liu","Lanqing Hong","Xin Jin","Zhenguo Li","James T.

We begin by applying cone singularity detection to identify a sparse set of potential handles. The VLM is then prompted to select both the deformable sub-parts of the mesh and the handles that best align with user instructions. Subsequently, we query the desired deformed positions of the selected handles in screen space. To reduce uncertainty inherent in VLM predictions, we aggregate the results from multiple camera views using a novel multi-view voting scheme. % Across a suite of benchmarks, our method produces deformations that align more closely with user intent, as measured by CLIP and GPTEval3D scores, while introducing low distortion -- quantified via membrane energy.

Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \\textit{Scapegoater}, who misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions; \\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own performance; \\textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt certain tools; and \\textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others. We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents. Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection mechanisms.

Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate) thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus, FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis.

Surprisingly, the most accurate and human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions. This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive \"System 1\"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to \"System 2\"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models or CoT prompting.

In this paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators, struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon, indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs' ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text.

While many-shot ICL shows promising performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios, we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g., Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B, and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.","authors":["Jianfei Zhang","Bei Li","Jun Bai","Rumei Li","Yanmeng Wang","Chenghua Lin","Wenge Rong"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579"}

By leveraging a powerful video inpainting foundation model as a generative prior, we reformulate 4D video creation as a video inpainting task, enabling the model to fill in missing content caused by camera trajectory changes or user edits. To facilitate this, we generate composite masked inpainting video data to effectively fine-tune the model for 4D video generation. Given an input video and its associated camera trajectory, we first perform depth-based point cloud rendering to obtain invisibility masks that indicate the regions that should be completed. Simultaneously, editing masks are introduced to specify user-defined modifications, and these are combined with the invisibility masks to create a composite masks dataset. During training, we randomly sample different types of masks to construct diverse and challenging inpainting scenarios, enhancing the model's generalization and robustness in various 4D editing and generation tasks. To handle temporal consistency under large camera motion, we design a self-iterative tuning strategy that gradually increases the viewing angles during training, where the model is used to generate the next-stage training data after each fine-tuning iteration.

However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that \"the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof\". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$ formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.","authors":["Chengwu Liu","Ye Yuan","Yichun Yin","Yan Xu","Xin Xu","Zaoyu Chen","Yasheng Wang","Lifeng Shang","Qun Liu","Ming Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592"}

The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\\%$ in dense networks.","authors":["Shumin Lian","Jingwen Tong","Jun Zhang","Liqun Fu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04594"}

To address these issues, we propose the Hierarchical Embodied Continual Learning Setups (HEC) that divide the agent's continual learning process into two layers: high-level instructions and low-level actions, and define five embodied continual learning sub-setups. Building on these setups, we introduce the Task-aware Mixture of Incremental LoRA Experts (Task-aware MoILE) method. This approach achieves task recognition by clustering visual-text embeddings and uses both a task-level router and a token-level router to select the appropriate LoRA experts. To effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting, we apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the LoRA parameters obtained from prior tasks, preserving key components while orthogonally training the remaining parts. The experimental results show that our method stands out in reducing the forgetting of old tasks compared to other methods, effectively supporting agents in retaining prior knowledge while continuously learning new tasks.","authors":["Ziqi Jia","Anmin Wang","Xiaoyang Qu","Xiaowen Yang","Jianzong Wang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04595"}

We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost. Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\\%$ zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B.

While diffusion-based methods have made progress in general 3D object generation, they continue to struggle with precise control over human identity, body shape, and animation readiness. In contrast, SmartAvatar leverages the commonsense reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with off-the-shelf parametric human generators to deliver high-quality, customizable avatars. A key innovation is an autonomous verification loop, where the agent renders draft avatars, evaluates facial similarity, anatomical plausibility, and prompt alignment, and iteratively adjusts generation parameters for convergence. This interactive, AI-guided refinement process promotes fine-grained control over both facial and body features, enabling users to iteratively refine their avatars via natural-language conversations. Unlike diffusion models that rely on static pre-trained datasets and offer limited flexibility, SmartAvatar brings users into the modeling loop and ensures continuous improvement through an LLM-driven procedural generation and verification system. The generated avatars are fully rigged and support pose manipulation with consistent identity and appearance, making them suitable for downstream animation and interactive applications. Quantitative benchmarks and user studies demonstrate that SmartAvatar outperforms recent text- and image-driven avatar generation systems in terms of reconstructed mesh quality, identity fidelity, attribute accuracy, and animation readiness, making it a versatile tool for realistic, customizable avatar creation on consumer-grade hardware.","authors":["Alexander Huang-Menders","Xinhang Liu","Andy Xu","Yuyao Zhang","Chi-Keung Tang","Yu-Wing Tai"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04606"}

Recent work has linked EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases, we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches.

This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.","authors":["Yuyang Wanyan","Xi Zhang","Haiyang Xu","Haowei Liu","Junyang Wang","Jiabo Ye","Yutong Kou","Ming Yan","Fei Huang","Xiaoshan Yang","Weiming Dong","Changsheng Xu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04614"}

Using data on millions of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in future.

Traditional pipelines composed of ``detector-descriptor, feature matcher, outlier filter, and geometric estimator'' falter in challenging scenarios. Recent deep-learning advances have significantly boosted both robustness and accuracy. This survey adopts a unique perspective by comprehensively reviewing how deep learning has incrementally transformed the classical image matching pipeline.

With dense voxel labels, prior works typically formulate it as a dense segmentation task, independently classifying each voxel. However, this paradigm neglects critical instance-centric discriminability, leading to instance-level incompleteness and adjacent ambiguities. To address this, we highlight a free lunch of occupancy labels: the voxel-level class label implicitly provides insight at the instance level, which is overlooked by the community. Motivated by this observation, we first introduce a training-free Voxel-to-Instance (VoxNT) trick: a simple yet effective method that freely converts voxel-level class labels into instance-level offset labels. Building on this, we further propose VoxDet, an instance-centric framework that reformulates the voxel-level occupancy prediction as dense object detection by decoupling it into two sub-tasks: offset regression and semantic prediction. Specifically, based on the lifted 3D volume, VoxDet first uses (a) Spatially-decoupled Voxel Encoder to generate disentangled feature volumes for the two sub-tasks, which learn task-specific spatial deformation in the densely projected tri-perceptive space. Then, we deploy (b) Task-decoupled Dense Predictor to address this task via dense detection. Here, we first regress a 4D offset field to estimate distances (6 directions) between voxels and object borders in the voxel space. The regressed offsets are then used to guide the instance-level aggregation in the classification branch, achieving instance-aware prediction. Experiments show that VoxDet can be deployed on both camera and LiDAR input, jointly achieving state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. VoxDet is not only highly efficient, but also achieves 63.0 IoU on the SemanticKITTI test set, ranking 1st on the online leaderboard.","authors":["Wuyang Li","Zhu Yu","Alexandre Alahi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04623"}

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.","authors":["Guruprerana Shabadi","Rajeev Alur"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04632"}

In contrast, models exhibit inconsistent performance gains from visual simulations, improving on most tasks but declining in specific cases like tangram puzzles (GPT-4o, o1) and cube net folding (Claude-3.5, Gemini-2.0 Flash), indicating that models may not know how to effectively leverage intermediate visual information.","authors":["Linjie Li","Mahtab Bigverdi","Jiawei Gu","Zixian Ma","Yinuo Yang","Ziang Li","Yejin Choi","Ranjay Krishna"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04633"}

This work presents a practical approach to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese.

Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark (CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning capabilities of SOTA models.","authors":["Lucas Irwin","Arda Kaz","Peiyao Sheng","Pramod Viswanath"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04636"}

Bandwidth control and regulation approaches have been proposed in the literature as an effective method to monitor and limit the impact of timing interference at run time. These approaches seek for fine-grained control of the bandwidth consumption (at the microsecond level) to meet stringent timing requirements on embedded critical systems. Such granularity and configurations, while effective, can become an entry barrier for the application of bandwidth control to a wide class of productized, modular ROS2 applications. This is so because those applications have less stringent timing requirements but would still benefit from bandwidth regulation, though under less restrictive, and therefore more portable, granularity and configurations.","authors":["Jon Altonaga Puente","Enrico Mezzetti","Irune Agirre Troncoso","Jaume Abella Ferrer","Francisco J.

Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit baseline while achieving comparable accuracy.

Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities, independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations, positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for efficient model adaptation.

The scheme comprises of three phases: initial segmentation, iterative vertex insertion, and iterative merging, followed by vertex adjustment. The initial segmentation is used to detect sharp turnings - the vertices that seemingly have high curvature. It is likely that some of important vertices with low curvature might have been missed out at the first phase and so iterative vertex insertion is used to add vertices in a region where the curvature changes slowly but steadily. The initial phase may pick up some undesirable vertices and so merging is used to eliminate the redundant vertices. Finally, vertex adjustment is used to facilitate enhancement in the aesthetic look of the approximation. The quality of the approximations is measured using Rosin's measure.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Feature-Based Lie Group Transformer for Real-World Applications","abstract":"The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background, which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.

However, few studies have focused on this issue in Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However, low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally, representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability to these labels.

Personalizing certain parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model. However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence, outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer communication rounds.","authors":["Shengkun Zhu","Feiteng Nie","Jinshan Zeng","Sheng Wang","Yuan Sun","Yuan Yao","Shangfeng Chen","Quanqing Xu","Chuanhui Yang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04672"}

Specifically, our approach leverages a Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) for parameter-efficient adaptation, ensuring a balanced allocation of trainable parameters between the backbone and the PCL module.Meanwhile, cross-module concept guidance enforces tight alignment between the backbone's feature representations and the prototypical concept activation patterns.In addition, we incorporate a multi-level feature preservation strategy that fuses spatial and semantic cues across various layers, thereby enriching the learned representations and mitigating the challenges posed by limited data availability.Finally, to enhance interpretability and minimize concept overlap, we introduce a geometry-aware concept discrimination loss that enforces orthogonality among concepts, encouraging more disentangled and transparent decision boundaries.Experimental results on six popular benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and DTD) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing SEMs by a notable margin, with 4.2%-8.7% relative gains in 5-way 5-shot classification.These findings highlight the efficacy of coupling concept learning with few-shot adaptation to achieve both higher accuracy and clearer model interpretability, paving the way for more transparent visual recognition systems.","authors":["Zhong Ji","Rongshuai Wei","Jingren Liu","Yanwei Pang","Jungong Han"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04673"}

A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"The cost of ensembling: is it always worth combining?","abstract":"Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger, accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance, achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts suitable for real-world applications.","authors":["Marco Zanotti"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04677"}

This paper presents BVLSM, a Write-Ahead Log (WAL)-time key-value separation mechanism designed to address three key challenges in LSM-Tree storage systems: write amplification, poor memory utilization, and I/O jitter under big-value workloads. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches that delay key-value separation until the flush stage, leading to redundant data in MemTables and repeated writes. BVLSM proactively decouples keys and values during the WAL phase. The MemTable stores only lightweight metadata, allowing multi-queue parallel store for big value. The benchmark results show that BVLSM significantly outperforms both RocksDB and BlobDB under 64KB random write workloads.

This paper examines the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods: they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.","authors":["Rapha\\\"el Milli\\`ere"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679"}

However, direct human testing poses risks due to possible exoskeleton malfunctions and inconsistent movement replication. To provide a safer and more repeatable testing environment, this study employs a bipedal robot platform to reproduce human gait, allowing for controlled exoskeleton evaluations. A control strategy based on the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) is formulated to achieve optimal torque control for accurate gait replication. The bipedal robot dynamics are represented using double pendulum model, where SDRE-optimized control inputs minimize deviations from human motion trajectories. To align with motor behavior constraints, a parameterized control method is introduced to simplify the control process while effectively replicating human gait. The proposed approach initially adopts a ramping trapezoidal velocity model, which is then adapted into a piecewise linear velocity-time representation through motor command overwriting. This modification enables finer control over gait phase transitions while ensuring compatibility with motor dynamics. The corresponding cost function optimizes the control parameters to minimize errors in joint angles, velocities, and torques relative to SDRE control result. By structuring velocity transitions in accordance with motor limitations, the method reduce the computational load associated with real-time control. Experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed parameterized control method in reproducing human gait. The bipedal robot platform provides a reliable and repeatable testing mechanism for knee-type exoskeletons, offering insights into exoskeleton performance under controlled conditions.","authors":["Ping-Kong Huang","Chien-Wu Lan","Chin-Tien Wu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04680"}

In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.","authors":["Thao Nguyen","Yang Li","Olga Golovneva","Luke Zettlemoyer","Sewoong Oh","Ludwig Schmidt","Xian Li"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04689"}

While smoothness has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this, we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance. Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.

In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a principled way.

However, the field of soft robotics is fairly new, and the design process of their morphology and their controller strategies has not yet been thoroughly studied. Consequently, here, an automated design method for the controller of soft actuators based on Neuroevolution is proposed. Specifically, the suggested techniques employ Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) to generate the synchronization profile of the components of a simulated soft actuator by employing Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). As a baseline methodology, a Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) was used. Moreover, to test the robustness of the proposed methodologies, both high- and low-performing morphologies of soft actuators were utilized as testbeds. Moreover, the use of an affluent and a more limited set of activation functions for the Neuroevolution targets was tested throughout the experiments. The results support the hypothesis that Neuroevolution based methodologies are more appropriate for designing controllers that align with both types of morphologies. In specific, NEAT performed better for all different scenarios tested and produced more simplistic networks that are easier to implement in real life applications.","authors":["Hugo Alcaraz-Herrera","Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas","Igor Balaz","Andrew Adamatzky"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04698"}

In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i) continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii) convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q = p/\\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections, defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density approximation.","authors":["Jos\\'e Manuel de Frutos","Manuel A.

This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head.

As the adapted models inevitably encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) test data that deviates from the in-distribution (ID) task-specific training data, enhancing OOD generalization in few-shot adaptation is critically important. We study robust few-shot VLM adaptation, aiming to increase both ID and OOD accuracy. By comparing different adaptation methods (e.g., prompt tuning, linear probing, contrastive finetuning, and full finetuning), we uncover three key findings: (1) finetuning with proper hyperparameters significantly outperforms the popular VLM adaptation methods prompt tuning and linear probing; (2) visual encoder-only finetuning achieves better efficiency and accuracy than contrastively finetuning both visual and textual encoders; (3) finetuning the top layers of the visual encoder provides the best balance between ID and OOD accuracy. Building on these findings, we propose partial finetuning of the visual encoder empowered with two simple augmentation techniques: (1) retrieval augmentation which retrieves task-relevant data from the VLM's pretraining dataset to enhance adaptation, and (2) adversarial perturbation which promotes robustness during finetuning. Results show that the former/latter boosts OOD/ID accuracy while slightly sacrificing the ID/OOD accuracy. Yet, perhaps understandably, naively combining the two does not maintain their best OOD/ID accuracy. We address this dilemma with the developed SRAPF, Stage-wise Retrieval Augmentation-based Adversarial Partial Finetuning. SRAPF consists of two stages: (1) partial finetuning the visual encoder using both ID and retrieved data, and (2) adversarial partial finetuning with few-shot ID data.

However, AIGVs still suffer from noticeable visual quality defects, such as noise, blurriness, frame jitter and low dynamic degree, which severely impact the user's viewing experience. Therefore, an effective automatic visual quality assessment is of great importance for AIGV content regulation and generative model improvement. In this work, we decompose the visual quality of AIGVs into three dimensions: technical quality, motion quality, and video semantics. For each dimension, we design corresponding encoder to achieve effective feature representation. Moreover, considering the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in various vision and language tasks, we introduce a LLM as the quality regression module. To better enable the LLM to establish reasoning associations between multi-dimensional features and visual quality, we propose a specially designed multi-modal prompt engineering framework. Additionally, we incorporate LoRA fine-tuning technology during the training phase, allowing the LLM to better adapt to specific tasks.

Predicting dissection trajectories in ESD videos offers significant potential for enhancing surgical skill training and simplifying the learning process, yet this area remains underexplored. While imitation learning has shown promise in acquiring skills from expert demonstrations, challenges persist in handling uncertain future movements, learning geometric symmetries, and generalizing to diverse surgical scenarios. To address these, we introduce a novel approach: Implicit Diffusion Policy with Equivariant Representations for Imitation Learning (iDPOE). Our method models expert behavior through a joint state action distribution, capturing the stochastic nature of dissection trajectories and enabling robust visual representation learning across various endoscopic views. By incorporating a diffusion model into policy learning, iDPOE ensures efficient training and sampling, leading to more accurate predictions and better generalization. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to generalize to geometric symmetries by embedding equivariance into the learning process. To address state mismatches, we develop a forward-process guided action inference strategy for conditional sampling. Using an ESD video dataset of nearly 2000 clips, experimental results show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, both explicit and implicit, in trajectory prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of imitation learning to surgical skill development for dissection trajectory prediction.","authors":["Hongyu Wang","Yonghao Long","Yueyao Chen","Hon-Chi Yip","Markus Scheppach","Philip Wai-Yan Chiu","Yeung Yam","Helen Mei-Ling Meng","Qi Dou"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04716"}

To complement a single model's lack of diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a \"sparta tribe\" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one, and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration. SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce more logical, direct and informative outputs.","authors":["Yuru Jiang","Wenxuan Ding","Shangbin Feng","Greg Durrett","Yulia Tsvetkov"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04721"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Beyond Accuracy: Dissecting Mathematical Reasoning for LLMs Under Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2) problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization. Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance, providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.","authors":["Jiayu Wang","Yifei Ming","Zixuan Ke","Caiming Xiong","Shafiq Joty","Aws Albarghouthi","Frederic Sala"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04723"}

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Bridging Annotation Gaps: Transferring Labels to Align Object Detection Datasets","abstract":"Combining multiple object detection datasets offers a path to improved generalisation but is hindered by inconsistencies in class semantics and bounding box annotations. Some methods to address this assume shared label taxonomies and address only spatial inconsistencies; others require manual relabelling, or produce a unified label space, which may be unsuitable when a fixed target label space is required. We propose Label-Aligned Transfer (LAT), a label transfer framework that systematically projects annotations from diverse source datasets into the label space of a target dataset. LAT begins by training dataset-specific detectors to generate pseudo-labels, which are then combined with ground-truth annotations via a Privileged Proposal Generator (PPG) that replaces the region proposal network in two-stage detectors. To further refine region features, a Semantic Feature Fusion (SFF) module injects class-aware context and features from overlapping proposals using a confidence-weighted attention mechanism. This pipeline preserves dataset-specific annotation granularity while enabling many-to-one label space transfer across heterogeneous datasets, resulting in a semantically and spatially aligned representation suitable for training a downstream detector. LAT thus jointly addresses both class-level misalignments and bounding box inconsistencies without relying on shared label spaces or manual annotations. Across multiple benchmarks, LAT demonstrates consistent improvements in target-domain detection performance, achieving gains of up to +4.8AP over semi-supervised baselines.","authors":["Mikhail Kennerley","Angelica Alives-Reviro","Carola-Bibiane Sch\\\"onlieb","Robby T.

Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges. The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without retraining entirely.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"SRD: Reinforcement-Learned Semantic Perturbation for Backdoor Defense in VLMs","abstract":"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in image captioning, but recent studies show they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Attackers can inject imperceptible perturbations-such as local pixel triggers or global semantic phrases-into the training data, causing the model to generate malicious, attacker-controlled captions for specific inputs. These attacks are hard to detect and defend due to their stealthiness and cross-modal nature. By analyzing attack samples, we identify two key vulnerabilities: (1) abnormal attention concentration on specific image regions, and (2) semantic drift and incoherence in generated captions. To counter this, we propose Semantic Reward Defense (SRD), a reinforcement learning framework that mitigates backdoor behavior without prior knowledge of triggers. SRD uses a Deep Q-Network to learn policies for applying discrete perturbations (e.g., occlusion, color masking) to sensitive image regions, aiming to disrupt the activation of malicious pathways. We design a semantic fidelity score as the reward signal, which jointly evaluates semantic consistency and linguistic fluency of the output, guiding the agent toward generating robust yet faithful captions. Experiments across mainstream VLMs and datasets show SRD reduces attack success rates to 5.6%, while preserving caption quality on clean inputs with less than 10% performance drop. SRD offers a trigger-agnostic, interpretable defense paradigm against stealthy backdoor threats in multimodal generative models.","authors":["Shuhan Xu","Siyuan Liang","Hongling Zheng","Yong Luo","Aishan Liu","Dacheng Tao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04743"}

However, up to 30% of users remain unable to effectively use BCIs-a phenomenon termed ''BCI inefficiency.'' This study addresses a major limitation in current BCI training protocols: the use of fixed-length training paradigms that ignore individual learning variability. We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal avalanches-spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity-as biomarkers to characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche length and activations. These features revealed significant training and taskcondition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in these features across sessions ($\\Delta$avalanche length and $\\Delta$activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest.

However, the absence of intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO). MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both reasoning and self-correction abilities.","authors":["Fei Ding","Baiqiao Wang","Zijian Zeng","Youwei Wang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04746"}

However, can smaller high-value datasets match or outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing computational costs by over 43%.

However, they ignore the effect of different components in the SSIM function and the corresponding hyperparameters on the training. To address these issues, this work proposes a new form of SSIM. Compared with original SSIM function, the proposed new form uses addition rather than multiplication to combine the luminance, contrast, and structural similarity related components in SSIM. The loss function constructed with this scheme helps result in smoother gradients and achieve higher performance on unsupervised depth estimation. We conduct extensive experiments to determine the relatively optimal combination of parameters for our new SSIM.

To mitigate these limitations, we explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven low-resource datasets.

However, at their core these models are still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention, an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards","abstract":"We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the rewards have a finite $(1+\\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by $\\upsilon$ for some $\\epsilon \\in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\\upsilon = \\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\\upsilon = \\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime with $\\upsilon = \\mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a $\\Omega(d^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}} T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}})$ lower bound. This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for linear bandits, in particular being $\\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the finite-variance case ($\\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^{\\frac{1+3\\epsilon}{2(1+\\epsilon)}} T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\\epsilon = 1$. We also establish a lower bound of $\\Omega(d^{\\frac{2\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}} T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \\le 1 + \\epsilon$, we can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing new regret bounds for the Mat\\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear for all $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1]$.","authors":["Artin Tajdini","Jonathan Scarlett","Kevin Jamieson"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"MMSU: A Massive Multi-task Spoken Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark","abstract":"Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content), paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics, semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models, highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding, providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech interaction systems.

Pair programming is a prominent instance. With the rise of AI coding assistants, developers now not only work with human partners but also, as some claim, with AI pair programmers. Although studies confirm knowledge transfer during human pair programming, its effectiveness with AI coding assistants remains uncertain. To analyze knowledge transfer in both human-human and human-AI settings, we conducted an empirical study where developer pairs solved a programming task without AI support, while a separate group of individual developers completed the same task using the AI coding assistant GitHub Copilot. We extended an existing knowledge transfer framework and employed a semi-automated evaluation pipeline to assess differences in knowledge transfer episodes across both settings. We found a similar frequency of successful knowledge transfer episodes and overlapping topical categories across both settings. Two of our key findings are that developers tend to accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions with less scrutiny than those from human pair programming partners, but also that GitHub Copilot can subtly remind developers of important code details they might otherwise overlook.","authors":["Alisa Welter","Niklas Schneider","Tobias Dick","Kallistos Weis","Christof Tinnes","Marvin Wyrich","Sven Apel"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04785"}

Among hard VQ methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the $k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.","authors":["Thore Gerlach","Sascha M\\\"ucke","Christian Bauckhage"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04786"}

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Object-X: Learning to Reconstruct Multi-Modal 3D Object Representations","abstract":"Learning effective multi-modal 3D representations of objects is essential for numerous applications, such as augmented reality and robotics. Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.","authors":["Gaia Di Lorenzo","Federico Tombari","Marc Pollefeys","Daniel Barath"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04789"}

Such systems often rely on random access protocols based on variations of ALOHA at the link layer, where collision resolution algorithms play a fundamental role to enable reliable delivery of packets. In this context, we provide the first analytical characterization of average AoI for the classical Capetanakis tree-based algorithm with gated access under exogenous traffic, capturing the protocol's dynamics, driven by sporadic packet generation and variable collision resolution times. We also explore a variant with early termination, where contention is truncated after a maximum number of slots even if not all users are resolved.

RANSAC and its variants are the gold standard for estimating geometric models (e.g., homographies, relative/absolute poses) from outlier-contaminated data. Despite RANSAC's apparent simplicity, achieving consistently high performance across different problems is challenging. While recent research often focuses on improving specific RANSAC components (e.g., sampling, scoring), overall performance is frequently more influenced by the \"bells and whistles\" (i.e., the implementation details and problem-specific optimizations) within a given library. Popular frameworks like OpenCV and PoseLib demonstrate varying performance, excelling in some tasks but lagging in others. We introduce SupeRANSAC, a novel unified RANSAC pipeline, and provide a detailed analysis of the techniques that make RANSAC effective for specific vision tasks, including homography, fundamental/essential matrix, and absolute/rigid pose estimation. SupeRANSAC is designed for consistent accuracy across these tasks, improving upon the best existing methods by, for example, 6 AUC points on average for fundamental matrix estimation.

In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a $\\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\\eta$ for a sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\\eta$. We verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.","authors":["Zhiwei Bai","Zhangchen Zhou","Jiajie Zhao","Xiaolong Li","Zhiyu Li","Feiyu Xiong","Hongkang Yang","Yaoyu Zhang","Zhi-Qin John Xu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04805"}

The accurate recognition of this vast number of characters, termed mega-category recognition, presents a formidable yet crucial challenge for cultural heritage preservation and digital applications. Despite significant advances in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), mega-category recognition remains unexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets, with the largest existing dataset containing merely 16,151 categories. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce MegaHan97K, a mega-category, large-scale dataset covering an unprecedented 97,455 categories of Chinese characters.

This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading techniques by over 10% overall.

Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements.

Existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model, EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models, while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories, inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare.","authors":["Chantal Pellegrini","Ege \\\"Ozsoy","David Bani-Harouni","Matthias Keicher","Nassir Navab"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04831"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models","abstract":"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit, multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines, offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.","authors":["Changyue Wang","Weihang Su","Qingyao Ai","Yiqun Liu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832"}

We identify five governance dimensions essential for responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination.

Such systems have matured significantly, demonstrating the ability to reason and comprehend implicit user intentions in two-dimensional contexts, producing accurate segmentation masks based on complex and implicit query text. However, a comparable framework and structure for 3D reasoning segmentation remain absent. This paper introduces OpenMaskDINO3D, a LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding and segmentation. OpenMaskDINO3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce instance segmentation masks, excelling in many 3D tasks.

A key factor in achieving high error correction performance is the use of soft-decision decoding for component codes. However, implementing optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability decoding for commonly used component codes, such as BCH and Polar codes, is computationally prohibitive. Instead, practical systems rely on approximations, with the Chase-Pyndiah algorithm being a widely used suboptimal method. TPC are more powerful than their component codes and begin to function effectively at low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, during the initial iterations, the component codes do not perform well and introduce errors in the extrinsic information updates. This phenomenon limits the performance of TPC. This paper proposes a neural network-aided rollback Chase-Pyndiah decoding method to address this issue. A transformer-based neural network identifies cases where extrinsic updates are likely to introduce errors, triggering a rollback mechanism which prevents the update and keeps the component code message intact. Our results demonstrate that a neural network with a relatively small number of parameters can effectively distinguish destructive updates and improve decoding performance. We evaluate the proposed approach using TPC with (256, 239) extended BCH component codes. We show that the proposed method enhances the bit error rate performance of Chase-Pyndiah p=6 decoding, achieving a gain of approximately 0.145 dB in a TPC scheme with four full iterations, significantly outperforming conventional Chase p=7 decoding.","authors":["Dmitry Artemasov","Oleg Nesterenkov","Kirill Andreev","Pavel Rybin","Alexey Frolov"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04839"}

The contact tractions between interacting discrete segments are evaluated with respect to a midplane in a single pass, inherently maintaining the equilibrium of tractions. These tractions are based on the penalisation of true interpenetration between opposite surfaces, and the procedure of their integral for discrete contacting segments is described in this paper. A meticulous examination of the different possible geometric configurations of interacting 3D segments is presented to develop visual understanding and better traction evaluation accuracy. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated against the analytical solutions of the contact patch test, two-beam bending, Hertzian contact, and flat punch test, thus proving the capability to reproduce contact between flat surfaces, curved surfaces, and sharp corners in contact, respectively. The method passes the contact patch test with the uniform transmission of contact pressure matching the accuracy levels of finite elements. It converges towards the analytical solution with mesh refinement and a suitably high penalty factor. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm also extends to self-contact problems and has been tested for self-contact between flat and curved surfaces with inelastic material. Dynamic problems of elastic and inelastic collisions between bars, as well as oblique collisions of cylinders, are also presented. The ability of the algorithm to resolve contacts between flat and curved surfaces for nonconformal meshes with high accuracy demonstrates its versatility in general contact problems.","authors":["Indrajeet Sahu","Nik Petrinic"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04841"}

In this paper, we introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35 different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally, the dataset comes with an estimation of the location of the targets, offering a benchmark for evaluating detection algorithms. We recorded approximately one hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around 38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames.

In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis, monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization) between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words.

Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational materials and question answering, but there are still space for new applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM, but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations, giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field.

These tools can alter styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide. In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.","authors":["Vishwa Mohan Singh","Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula","Ahan Chatterjee","Beste Aydemir","Rifat Mehreen Amin"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04852"}

Using eight open-source large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10, and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.","authors":["D\\'avid Javorsk\\'y","Ond\\v{r}ej Bojar","Fran\\c{c}ois Yvon"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04855"}

This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role of the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in controlling divergence error is also validated.","authors":["Junming Duan","Praveen Chandrashekar","Christian Klingenberg"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04857"}

To mitigate these aspects, this study implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability, achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive load compared to desktop tools.

Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within domains such as images and language model activation patterns.","authors":["Yin Lu","Tong He","Xuening Zhu","David Wipf"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859"}

We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens of the Information Bottleneck Principle.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models","abstract":"Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept. This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer greater flexibility in key design choices.","authors":["Antonio Almud\\'evar","Jos\\'e Miguel Hern\\'andez-Lobato","Alfonso Ortega"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877"}

However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data. We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of our approach.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications","abstract":"This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \\emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.","authors":["Ioana Hustiu","Roozbeh Abolpour","Cristian Mahulea","Marius Kloetzer"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04881"}

We have developed a pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks, combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%), the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.","authors":["Allen Paul","George Grammatopoulos","Adwaye Rambojun","Neill D.

To model this intuition-driven planning process, we train a transformer encoder using supervised contrastive learning to embed board states into a latent space structured by positional evaluation. In this space, distance reflects evaluative similarity, and visualized trajectories display interpretable transitions between game states. We demonstrate that move selection can occur entirely within this embedding space by advancing toward favorable regions, without relying on deep search. Despite using only a 6-ply beam search, our model achieves an estimated Elo rating of 2593. Performance improves with both model size and embedding dimensionality, suggesting that latent planning may offer a viable alternative to traditional search. Although we focus on chess, the proposed embedding-based planning method can be generalized to other perfect-information games where state evaluations are learnable.

Moreover, current evaluation metrics such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2) A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.

However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,632 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best performance model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves only 23.57% accuracy on space-level tasks and 33.94% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks.

Existing long context and multi-hop QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers fine-grained controls for both narrative size \\emph{and} reasoning difficulty. Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge work.","authors":["Alex Pan","Mary-Anne Williams"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907"}

To obtain useful geometry estimates, we explore utilizing the reconstructed geometry from the explicit 3D representations as well as depth estimates from the FoundationStereo model in an expert knowledge transfer setup. We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models. Moreover, we also reveal that while the latest Gaussian Splatting based methods have achieved superior performance on established benchmarks, their robustness falls short in challenging in-the-wild settings warranting further exploration.","authors":["Filip Slezak","Magnus K.

Using representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting \"deception vectors\" via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy.

The fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better performance with limited training data.

Several known variants of the BWT can be viewed as instances of the eBWT applied to specific decompositions of a word. A central property of the BWT, essential for its compressibility, is the number of maximal ranges of equal letters, named runs. In this article, we explore how different decompositions of a word impact the number of runs in the resulting eBWT. First, we show that the number of decompositions of a word is exponential, even under minimal constraints on the size of the subsets in the decomposition. Second, we present an infinite family of words for which the ratio of the number of runs between the worst and best decompositions is unbounded, under the same minimal constraints.

Instead of the pillbug body, a loopcoupled mechanism based on slider-crank mechanisms is utilized to achieve the rolling up and spreading motion. This mechanism precisely imitates three distinct curves that mimic the shape morphing of a pillbug. To decrease the degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the mechanism to one, scissor mechanisms are added. 3D curved shells are then attached to the tracer points of the morphing mechanism to safeguard it from attacks while allowing it to roll. Through type and dimensional synthesis, a complete system that includes shells and an underlying morphing mechanism is developed. A 3D model is created and tested to demonstrate the proposed system's shape-changing capability. Lastly, a robot with two modes is developed based on the proposed mechanism, which can curl up to roll down hills and can spread to move in a straight line via wheels.","authors":["Jieyu Wang (LS2N","LS2N - \\'equipe RoMas)","Yingzhong Tian (LS2N","LS2N - \\'equipe RoMas)","Fengfeng Xi (LS2N","LS2N - \\'equipe RoMas)","Damien Chablat (LS2N","LS2N - \\'equipe RoMas)","Jianing Lin","Gaoke Ren","Yinjun Zhao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04942"}

Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.","authors":["Marta Vanin","Frederik Geth","Rahmat Heidari","Dirk Van Hertem"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04949"}

However, current approaches either address partial embryo evaluation lacking holistic quality assessment or target clinical outcomes inevitably confounded by extra-embryonic factors, both limiting clinical utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task called Video-Based Embryo Grading - the first paradigm that directly utilizes full-length time-lapse monitoring (TLM) videos to predict embryologists' overall quality assessments. To support this task, we curate a real-world clinical dataset comprising over 2,500 TLM videos, each annotated with a grading label indicating the overall quality of embryos. Grounded in clinical decision-making principles, we propose a Complementary Spatial-Temporal Pattern Mining (CoSTeM) framework that conceptually replicates embryologists' evaluation process. The CoSTeM comprises two branches: (1) a morphological branch using a Mixture of Cross-Attentive Experts layer and a Temporal Selection Block to select discriminative local structural features, and (2) a morphokinetic branch employing a Temporal Transformer to model global developmental trajectories, synergistically integrating static and dynamic determinants for grading embryos. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our design. This work provides a valuable methodological framework for AI-assisted embryo selection. The dataset and source code will be publicly available upon acceptance.","authors":["Yong Sun","Yipeng Wang","Junyu Shi","Zhiyuan Zhang","Yanmei Xiao","Lei Zhu","Manxi Jiang","Qiang Nie"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04950"}

Yet their adoption brings a fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust. Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses -- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through data to engineering it through design.","authors":["Igor Meleshin","Anna Chistyakova","Anastasia Antsiferova","Dmitriy Vatolin"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04951"}

The objective is to maximize the aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem.

Existing Transformer-based approaches face critical limitations, including insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity from self-attention, and coarse denoising guidance from timestep embeddings when handling varying noise levels. In this work, we propose FEAT, a full-dimensional efficient attention Transformer, which addresses these issues through three key innovations: (1) a unified paradigm with sequential spatial-temporal-channel attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies across all dimensions, (2) a linear-complexity design for attention mechanisms in each dimension, utilizing weighted key-value attention and global channel attention, and (3) a residual value guidance module that provides fine-grained pixel-level guidance to adapt to different noise levels. We evaluate FEAT on standard benchmarks and downstream tasks, demonstrating that FEAT-S, with only 23\\% of the parameters of the state-of-the-art model Endora, achieves comparable or even superior performance.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Nonlinear elastodynamic material identification of heterogeneous isogeometric Bernoulli-Euler beams","abstract":"This paper presents a Finite Element Model Updating framework for identifying heterogeneous material distributions in planar Bernoulli-Euler beams based on a rotation-free isogeometric formulation. The procedure follows two steps: First, the elastic properties are identified from quasi-static displacements; then, the density is determined from modal data (low frequencies and mode shapes), given the previously obtained elastic properties. The identification relies on three independent discretizations: the isogeometric finite element mesh, a high-resolution grid of experimental measurements, and a material mesh composed of low-order Lagrange elements. The material mesh approximates the unknown material distributions, with its nodal values serving as design variables. The error between experiments and numerical model is expressed in a least squares manner. The objective is minimized using local optimization with the trust-region method, providing analytical derivatives to accelerate computations. Several numerical examples exhibiting large displacements are provided to test the proposed approach. To alleviate membrane locking, the B2M1 discretization is employed when necessary. Quasi-experimental data is generated using refined finite element models with random noise applied up to 4%. The method yields satisfactory results as long as a sufficient amount of experimental data is available, even for high measurement noise. Regularization is used to ensure a stable solution for dense material meshes. The density can be accurately reconstructed based on the previously identified elastic properties. The proposed framework can be straightforwardly extended to shells and 3D continua.","authors":["Bart{\\l}omiej {\\L}azorczyk","Roger A. Sauer"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04960"}

Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems. However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline (by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per generated exploit.","authors":["Deniz Simsek","Aryaz Eghbali","Michael Pradel"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04962"}

Our findings show that while displayed search results remain largely stable, the search engine's identified user interests shift significantly under obfuscation. We further demonstrate that such random queries can prevent accurate profiling and overwrite established user profiles. This study provides practical evidence for query obfuscation as a viable privacy-preserving mechanism and introduces a tool that enables users to autonomously protect their search behaviour without modifying existing infrastructure.","authors":["Anton Firc","Jan Klus\\'a\\v{c}ek","Kamil Malinka"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04963"}

Current monitoring methods involve ground measurements, requiring extensive cost, time and labor. Advances in drone remote sensing and computer vision offer great potential for mapping individual trees from aerial imagery at broad-scale. Large pre-trained vision models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), represent a particularly compelling choice given limited labeled data. In this work, we compare methods leveraging SAM for the task of automatic tree crown instance segmentation in high resolution drone imagery in three use cases: 1) boreal plantations, 2) temperate forests and 3) tropical forests. We also study the integration of elevation data into models, in the form of Digital Surface Model (DSM) information, which can readily be obtained at no additional cost from RGB drone imagery. We present BalSAM, a model leveraging SAM and DSM information, which shows potential over other methods, particularly in the context of plantations. We find that methods using SAM out-of-the-box do not outperform a custom Mask R-CNN, even with well-designed prompts.

Public Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs), suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand, may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models, particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private 4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the private CBRS network.

While quantizing weights and activations is effective at improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant, which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values, (3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap, dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP. Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.","authors":["Boris van Breugel","Yelysei Bondarenko","Paul Whatmough","Markus Nagel"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04985"}

While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust vulnerability detection.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Multi-scale Image Super Resolution with a Single Auto-Regressive Model","abstract":"In this paper we tackle Image Super Resolution (ISR), using recent advances in Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) modeling. VAR iteratively estimates the residual in latent space between gradually increasing image scales, a process referred to as next-scale prediction. Thus, the strong priors learned during pre-training align well with the downstream task (ISR). To our knowledge, only VARSR has exploited this synergy so far, showing promising results. However, due to the limitations of existing residual quantizers, VARSR works only at a fixed resolution, i.e. it fails to map intermediate outputs to the corresponding image scales. Additionally, it relies on a 1B transformer architecture (VAR-d24), and leverages a large-scale private dataset to achieve state-of-the-art results. We address these limitations through two novel components: a) a Hierarchical Image Tokenization approach with a multi-scale image tokenizer that progressively represents images at different scales while simultaneously enforcing token overlap across scales, and b) a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) regularization term that, relying solely on the LR and HR tokenizations, encourages the transformer to produce the latter over the former. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a quantizer is trained to force semantically consistent residuals at different scales, and the first time that preference-based optimization is used to train a VAR. Using these two components, our model can denoise the LR image and super-resolve at half and full target upscale factors in a single forward pass. Additionally, we achieve \\textit{state-of-the-art results on ISR}, while using a small model (300M params vs ~1B params of VARSR), and without using external training data.","authors":["Enrique Sanchez","Isma Hadji","Adrian Bulat","Christos Tzelepis","Brais Martinez","Georgios Tzimiropoulos"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04990"}

To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.","authors":["Edoardo Bianchi","Antonio Liotta"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04996"}

This empirical study investigates methods to reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging. Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at 2.8% memory footprint.

While traditional flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models.

This task is extremely challenging because Chinese text often features complex and diverse layouts in real-world scenes. Current efforts tend to inherit the solution for English scene text retrieval, failing to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we establish a Diversified Layout benchmark for Chinese Street View Text Retrieval (DL-CSVTR), which is specifically designed to evaluate retrieval performance across various text layouts, including vertical, cross-line, and partial alignments. To address the limitations in existing methods, we propose Chinese Scene Text Retrieval CLIP (CSTR-CLIP), a novel model that integrates global visual information with multi-granularity alignment training. CSTR-CLIP applies a two-stage training process to overcome previous limitations, such as the exclusion of visual features outside the text region and reliance on single-granularity alignment, thereby enabling the model to effectively handle diverse text layouts. Experiments on existing benchmark show that CSTR-CLIP outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 18.82% accuracy and also provides faster inference speed. Further analysis on DL-CSVTR confirms the superior performance of CSTR-CLIP in handling various text layouts.

This is probably because there is no rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.","authors":["Yongjie Xiao","Hongru Liang","Peixin Qin","Yao Zhang","Wenqiang Lei"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05000"}

The overhead mainly comes from sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses.

In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them.

Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients (IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines.

However, LLMs might still face the challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500 demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving the effectiveness of AR-Checker.","authors":["Yutao Hou","Zeguan Xiao","Fei Yu","Yihan Jiang","Xuetao Wei","Hailiang Huang","Yun Chen","Guanhua Chen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05038"}

Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec (iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a versatile approach for inductive node representation learning.

With the ability in alleviating data sparsity, contrastive learning is prevailing in the task. However, we spot that existing contrastive learning based methods still suffer from three obstacles: (1) they overlook item-level sparsity and primarily focus on session-level sparsity; (2) they typically augment sessions using item IDs like crop, mask and reorder, failing to ensure the semantic consistency of augmented views; (3) they treat all positive-negative signals equally, without considering their varying utility. To this end, we propose a novel multi-modal adaptive contrastive learning framework called MACL for session-based recommendation. In MACL, a multi-modal augmentation is devised to generate semantically consistent views at both item and session levels by leveraging item multi-modal features. Besides, we present an adaptive contrastive loss that distinguishes varying contributions of positive-negative signals to improve self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MACL over state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Xiaokun Zhang","Bo Xu","Fenglong Ma","Zhizheng Wang","Liang Yang","Hongfei Lin"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05044"}

While recent training-free approaches have made progress by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, they typically rely on inversion-based techniques that map input videos into the latent space, which often leads to temporal inconsistencies and degraded structural fidelity. To address this, we propose FlowDirector, a novel inversion-free video editing framework. Our framework models the editing process as a direct evolution in data space, guiding the video via an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to smoothly transition along its inherent spatiotemporal manifold, thereby preserving temporal coherence and structural details. To achieve localized and controllable edits, we introduce an attention-guided masking mechanism that modulates the ODE velocity field, preserving non-target regions both spatially and temporally. Furthermore, to address incomplete edits and enhance semantic alignment with editing instructions, we present a guidance-enhanced editing strategy inspired by Classifier-Free Guidance, which leverages differential signals between multiple candidate flows to steer the editing trajectory toward stronger semantic alignment without compromising structural consistency. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that FlowDirector achieves state-of-the-art performance in instruction adherence, temporal consistency, and background preservation, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and coherent video editing without inversion.","authors":["Guangzhao Li","Yanming Yang","Chenxi Song","Chi Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05046"}

For instance, powered wheelchairs face increasing risks of obesity and deconditioning due to inactivity. Conversely, manual wheelchair users, who propel the wheelchair by pushing the wheelchair's handrims, often face upper extremity injuries from repetitive motions. These challenges underscore the need for a mobility system that promotes activity while minimizing injury risk. Maintaining optimal exertion during wheelchair use enhances health benefits and engagement, yet the variations in individual physiological responses complicate exertion optimization. To address this, we introduce PulseRide, a novel wheelchair system that provides personalized assistance based on each user's physiological responses, helping them maintain their physical exertion goals. Unlike conventional assistive systems focused on obstacle avoidance and navigation, PulseRide integrates real-time physiological data-such as heart rate and ECG-with wheelchair speed to deliver adaptive assistance. Using a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach with Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN), the system adjusts push assistance to keep users within a moderate activity range without under- or over-exertion. We conducted preliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and slate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for individual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity zone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users, we observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent, delaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement. These results indicate that PulseRide offers a healthier, adaptive mobility solution, bridging the gap between passive and physically taxing mobility options.","authors":["Azizul Zahid","Bibek Poudel","Danny Scott","Jason Scott","Scott Crouter","Weizi Li","Sai Swaminathan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05056"}

In contrast, linear models are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction, assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various regression and classification settings.","authors":["Shijian Xu","Marcello Massimo Negri","Volker Roth"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05059"}

In this work, we present DemoSpeedup, a self-supervised method to accelerate visuomotor policy execution via entropy-guided demonstration acceleration. DemoSpeedup starts from training an arbitrary generative policy (e.g., ACT or Diffusion Policy) on normal-speed demonstrations, which serves as a per-frame action entropy estimator. The key insight is that frames with lower action entropy estimates call for more consistent policy behaviors, which often indicate the demands for higher-precision operations. In contrast, frames with higher entropy estimates correspond to more casual sections, and therefore can be more safely accelerated. Thus, we segment the original demonstrations according to the estimated entropy, and accelerate them by down-sampling at rates that increase with the entropy values. Trained with the speedup demonstrations, the resulting policies execute up to 3 times faster while maintaining the task completion performance. Interestingly, these policies could even achieve higher success rates than those trained with normal-speed demonstrations, due to the benefits of reduced decision-making horizons.","authors":["Lingxiao Guo","Zhengrong Xue","Zijing Xu","Huazhe Xu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05064"}

We then reformulate the problem so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent system from the data without increasing runtime.

In humans, such reports are often attributed to a faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably) not accompanied by conscious experience.","authors":["Iulia Com\\c{s}a","Murray Shanahan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068"}

Prior work encoded user-item interactions or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning, boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we propose $\\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy, with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement in HitRatio@1 and $\\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM.

To address this, we propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations (qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM, enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation.

NVM, along with Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), Solid State Disk (SSD), and Disk present a system designer with a wide array of options in designing caching middleware. Moreover, design decisions to replicate a data item in more than one level of a caching memory hierarchy may enhance the overall system performance with a faster recovery time in the event of a memory failure. Given a fixed budget, the key configuration questions are: Which storage media should constitute the memory hierarchy? What is the storage capacity of each hierarchy? Should data be replicated or partitioned across the different levels of the hierarchy? We model these cache configuration questions as an instance of the Multiple Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). This model is guided by the specification of each type of memory along with an application's database characteristics and its workload. Although MCKP is NP-complete, its linear programming relaxation is efficiently solvable and can be used to closely approximate the optimal solution. We use the resulting simple algorithm to evaluate design tradeoffs in the context of a memory hierarchy for a Key-Value Store (e.g., memcached) as well as a host-side cache (e.g., Flashcache). The results show selective replication is appropriate with certain failure rates and workload characteristics.

Automated GUI testing approaches of different strategies have been developed, while there are still huge gaps between the approaches and the app business logic, not taking the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target, leading to the exploration missing of critical app functionalities. Learning from the manual testing, which takes testing scenarios with app business logic as the basic granularity, in this paper, we utilize the LLMs to understand the semantics presented in app GUI and how they are mapped in the testing context based on specific testing scenarios. Then, scenario-based GUI tests are generated with the guidance of multi-agent collaboration.

The Observer perceives the app GUI state by extracting GUI widgets and forming GUI layouts, understanding the expressed semantics. Then the app GUI info is sent to the Decider to make decisions on target widgets based on the target testing scenarios. The decision-making process takes the completion of specific testing scenarios as the exploration target. The Executor then executes the demanding operations on the apps. The execution results are checked by the Supervisor on whether the generated tests are consistent with the completion target of the testing scenarios, ensuring the traceability of the test generation and execution. Furthermore, the corresponding GUI test operations are recorded to the context memory by Recorder as an important basis for further decision-making, meanwhile monitoring the runtime bug occurrences.

This study proposes an interpretable, image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for perceptual urban diagnostics.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Early linguistic fingerprints of online users who engage with conspiracy communities","abstract":"Online social media platforms are often seen as catalysts for radicalization, as they provide spaces where extreme beliefs can take root and spread, sometimes leading to real-world consequences. Conspiracy theories represent a specific form of radicalization that is notoriously resistant to online moderation strategies. One explanation for this resilience is the presence of a \"conspiratorial mindset\", a cognitive framework that fundamentally shapes how conspiracy believers perceive reality. However, the role of this mindset in driving online user behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze the psycholinguistic patterns of Reddit users who become active in a prominent conspiracy community by examining their activity in mainstream communities, which allows us to isolate linguistic markers for the presence of a conspiratorial mindset. We find that conspiracy-engaged individuals exhibit distinct psycholinguistic fingerprints, setting them apart from the general user population. Crucially, this signal is already evident in their online activity prior to joining the conspiracy community, allowing us to predict their involvement years in advance. These findings suggest that individuals who adopt conspiracy beliefs do not radicalize through community involvement, but possess a pre-existing conspiratorial mindset, which predisposes them to seek out and join extreme communities. By challenging the view that online social media platforms actively radicalize users into conspiracy theory beliefs, our findings suggest that standard moderation strategies have limited impact on curbing radicalization, and highlight the need for more targeted, supportive interventions that encourage disengagement from extremist narratives. Ultimately, this work contributes to fostering safer online and offline environments for public discourse.","authors":["Francesco Corso","Giuseppe Russo","Francesco Pierri","Gianmarco De Francisci Morales"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05086"}

This study introduces a novel Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies. Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions: for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile infrastructural precision with lived experience.","authors":["HaoTian Lan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05087"}

While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity, showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.

This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.","authors":["Aneesh Deogan","Wout Beks","Peter Teurlings","Koen de Vos","Mark van den Brand","Rene van de Molengraft"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05092"}

First, we establish negative results showing that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy beyond the model's inherent guarantees.

In this paper, we propose a fast and computationally efficient dual-layer exploration planning method. The insight of our dual-layer method is efficiently finding an acceptable long-term region routing and greedily exploring the target in the region of the first routing area with high speed. Specifically, the proposed method finds the long-term area routing through an approximate algorithm to ensure real-time planning in large-scale environments. Then, the viewpoint in the first routing region with the lowest curvature-penalized cost, which can effectively reduce decelerations caused by sharp turn motions, will be chosen as the next exploration target. To further speed up the exploration, we adopt an aggressive and safe exploration-oriented trajectory to enhance exploration continuity. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art methods in challenging simulation environments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of exploration efficiency, computational cost, and trajectory speed. We also conduct real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better capture the distinguishing features between different categories by constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text. Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework, CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection effect.","authors":["Tianyi Huang","Zikun Cui","Cuiqianhe Du","Chia-En Chiang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05107"}

However, this has come at the cost of representation diversity. While automatic evaluation methods exist for benchmarking model diversity, they either require reference image datasets or lack specificity about the kind of diversity measured, limiting their adaptability and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce the Does-it/Can-it framework, DIM-CIM, a reference-free measurement of default-mode diversity (\"Does\" the model generate images with expected attributes?) and generalization capacity (\"Can\" the model generate diverse attributes for a particular concept?). We construct the COCO-DIMCIM benchmark, which is seeded with COCO concepts and captions and augmented by a large language model. With COCO-DIMCIM, we find that widely-used models improve in generalization at the cost of default-mode diversity when scaling from 1.5B to 8.1B parameters. DIMCIM also identifies fine-grained failure cases, such as attributes that are generated with generic prompts but are rarely generated when explicitly requested. Finally, we use DIMCIM to evaluate the training data of a T2I model and observe a correlation of 0.85 between diversity in training images and default-mode diversity. Our work provides a flexible and interpretable framework for assessing T2I model diversity and generalization, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of model performance.","authors":["Revant Teotia","Candace Ross","Karen Ullrich","Sumit Chopra","Adriana Romero-Soriano","Melissa Hall","Matthew J.

However, current approaches face two key limitations: their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components: metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed, human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.","authors":["Tennison Liu","Mihaela van der Schaar"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109"}

However, due to the sim-to-real gap and lack of explainability, unconstrained RL policies deployed in the real world still suffer from inevitable safety issues, such as joint collisions, excessive torque, or foot slippage in low-friction environments. These problems limit its usage in missions with strict safety requirements, such as planetary exploration, nuclear facility inspection, and deep-sea operations. In this paper, we design a hierarchical optimization-based whole-body follower, which integrates both hard and soft constraints into RL framework to make the robot move with better safety guarantees. Leveraging the advantages of model-based control, our approach allows for the definition of various types of hard and soft constraints during training or deployment, which allows for policy fine-tuning and mitigates the challenges of sim-to-real transfer. Meanwhile, it preserves the robustness of RL when dealing with locomotion in complex unstructured environments.

We extend the space of pseudo-fakes by using Poisson blending, more diverse masks, generator artifacts, and distractors.

Thus, we argue that effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.

In this study, we systematically compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al. (2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings, evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour. Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao, replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to distinguish between error types as clearly as humans.

A QLA consists of a QWA and an aggregator function. For example, given a QWA A, the infimum aggregator maps each language L to the greatest lower bound assigned by A to any word in L. For boolean value sets, QWAs define boolean properties of traces, and QLAs define boolean properties of sets of traces, i.e., hyperproperties. For more general value sets, QLAs serve as a specification language for a generalization of hyperproperties, called quantitative hyperproperties. A nonprobabilistic (resp. probabilistic) quantitative hyperproperty assigns a value to each set (resp. distribution) G of traces, e.g., the minimal (resp. expected) average response time exhibited by the traces in G. We give several examples of quantitative hyperproperties and investigate three paradigmatic problems for QLAs: evaluation, nonemptiness, and universality. In the evaluation problem, given a QLA AA and an implementation G, we ask for the value that AA assigns to G. In the nonemptiness (resp. universality) problem, given a QLA AA and a value k, we ask whether AA assigns at least k to some (resp. every) language. We provide a comprehensive picture of decidability for these problems for QLAs with common aggregators as well as their restrictions to omega-regular languages and trace distributions generated by finite-state Markov chains.","authors":["Thomas A.

The greatest challenge in this area is mentally reconstructing complex 3D anatomical structures from 2D slices with millimetric precision, which is required in procedures like External Ventricular Drain (EVD) placement. MR technologies have shown great potential in improving surgical performance, however, their limited availability in clinical settings underscores the need for training systems that foster skill retention in unaided conditions. In this paper, we introduce NeuroMix, an MR-based simulator for EVD placement. We conduct a study with 48 participants to assess the impact of 2D and 3D visual aids on usability, cognitive load, technology acceptance, and procedure precision and execution time. Three training modalities are compared: one without visual aids, one with 2D aids only, and one combining both 2D and 3D aids. The training phase takes place entirely on digital objects, followed by a freehand EVD placement testing phase performed with a physical catherer and a physical phantom without MR aids. We then compare the participants performance with that of a control group that does not undergo training. Our findings show that participants trained with both 2D and 3D aids achieve a 44\\% improvement in precision during unaided testing compared to the control group, substantially higher than the improvement observed in the other groups. All three training modalities receive high usability and technology acceptance ratings, with significant equivalence across groups. The combination of 2D and 3D visual aids does not significantly increase cognitive workload, though it leads to longer operation times during freehand testing compared to the control group.","authors":["Pasquale Cascarano","Andrea Loretti","Matteo Martinoni","Luca Zanuttini","Alessio Di Pasquale","Gustavo Marfia"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05164"}

However, most learned policies rely on discrete action chunking, which introduces discontinuities at chunk boundaries. These discontinuities degrade motion quality and are particularly problematic in dynamic tasks such as throwing or lifting heavy objects, where smooth trajectories are critical for momentum transfer and system stability. In this work, we present a lightweight post-optimization framework for smoothing chunked action sequences. Our method combines three key components: (1) inference-aware chunk scheduling to proactively generate overlapping chunks and avoid pauses from inference delays; (2) linear blending in the overlap region to reduce abrupt transitions; and (3) jerk-minimizing trajectory optimization constrained within a bounded perturbation space. The proposed method was validated on a position-controlled robotic arm performing dynamic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces vibration and motion jitter, leading to smoother execution and improved mechanical robustness.","authors":["Dongwoo Son","Suhan Park"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05165"}

Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.","authors":["Bhavik Chandna","Zubair Bashir","Procheta Sen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05166"}

However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or \\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer.

We present Fabrica, a dual-arm robotic system capable of end-to-end planning and control for autonomous assembly of general multi-part objects. For planning over long horizons, we develop hierarchies of precedence, sequence, grasp, and motion planning with automated fixture generation, enabling general multi-step assembly on any dual-arm robots. The planner is made efficient through a parallelizable design and is optimized for downstream control stability. For contact-rich assembly steps, we propose a lightweight reinforcement learning framework that trains generalist policies across object geometries, assembly directions, and grasp poses, guided by equivariance and residual actions obtained from the plan. These policies transfer zero-shot to the real world and achieve 80% successful steps. For systematic evaluation, we propose a benchmark suite of multi-part assemblies resembling industrial and daily objects across diverse categories and geometries.

The earliest related works in this field based on template matching did not require a training process, and I believe they have never died. Because these methods possess a strong physical interpretability and are closer to the basis of theoretical signal processing research. In this paper, I would like to try to return to the original path by attempting to eschew neural networks to achieve the TWR HAR task and challenge to achieve intelligent recognition as neural network models.

Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance, leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.","authors":["Linxuan He","Qing-Shan Jia","Ang Li","Hongyan Sang","Ling Wang","Jiwen Lu","Tao Zhang","Jie Zhou","Yi Zhang","Yisen Wang","Peng Wei","Zhongyuan Wang","Henry X.

This trend makes it essential for regulators to focus on these interactions to manage smart city practices effectively and prevent unethical outcomes. To facilitate ethical analysis for smart city applications, this paper introduces a judgment framework that examines various scenarios where ethical issues may arise. Employing a multi-agent approach, the framework incorporates diverse social entities and applies logic-based ethical rules to identify potential violations. Through a rights-based analysis, we developed a set of 13 ethical principles and rules to guide ethical practices in smart cities. We utilized two specification languages, Prototype Verification System (PVS) and Alloy, to model our multi-agent system. Our analysis suggests that Alloy may be more efficient for formalizing smart cities and conducting ethical rule checks, particularly with the assistance of a human evaluator. Simulations of a real-world smart city application demonstrate that our ethical judgment framework effectively detects unethical outcomes and can be extended for practical use.","authors":["Weichen Shi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05172"}

Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one- and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks (equivalently, the attention mechanism).","authors":["Joshua Hess","Quaid Morris"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05178"}

We quantify factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and evaluating their performance in the other.

Most methods typically follow a two-stage paradigm where a trained 3D detector's optimized backbone parameters are used to initialize a grounding model. In this study, we explore a fundamental question: Does embodied 3D grounding benefit enough from detection? To answer this question, we assess the grounding performance of detection models using predicted boxes filtered by the target category. Surprisingly, these detection models without any instruction-specific training outperform the grounding models explicitly trained with language instructions. This indicates that even category-level embodied 3D grounding may not be well resolved, let alone more fine-grained context-aware grounding. Motivated by this finding, we propose DEGround, which shares DETR queries as object representation for both DEtection and Grounding and enables the grounding to benefit from basic category classification and box detection. Based on this framework, we further introduce a regional activation grounding module that highlights instruction-related regions and a query-wise modulation module that incorporates sentence-level semantic into the query representation, strengthening the context-aware understanding of language instructions.

We develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and adapt dynamically to in-context examples.","authors":["Gen Li","Yuchen Jiao","Yu Huang","Yuting Wei","Yuxin Chen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05200"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Trustworthiness Preservation by Copies of Machine Learning Systems","abstract":"A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test) sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose behavour is known.","authors":["Leonardo Ceragioli","Giuseppe Primiero"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05203"}

Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.","authors":["Yanbo Wang","Ziyi Wang","Wenzhao Zheng","Jie Zhou","Jiwen Lu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204"}

We introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context. Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated, mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks, finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases, models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex instructions.","authors":["Jackson Petty","Michael Y.

As for the motion-transfer task, current methods mainly use two-stage Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) finetuning to obtain better performance. However, existing adaptation-based motion transfer still suffers from motion inconsistency and tuning inefficiency when applied to large video diffusion transformers. Naive two-stage LoRA tuning struggles to maintain motion consistency between generated and input videos due to the inherent spatial-temporal coupling in the 3D attention operator. Additionally, they require time-consuming fine-tuning processes in both stages. To tackle these issues, we propose Follow-Your-Motion, an efficient two-stage video motion transfer framework that finetunes a powerful video diffusion transformer to synthesize complex motion.Specifically, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled LoRA to decouple the attention architecture for spatial appearance and temporal motion processing. During the second training stage, we design the sparse motion sampling and adaptive RoPE to accelerate the tuning speed. To address the lack of a benchmark for this field, we introduce MotionBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse motion, including creative camera motion, single object motion, multiple object motion, and complex human motion. We show extensive evaluations on MotionBench to verify the superiority of Follow-Your-Motion.","authors":["Yue Ma","Yulong Liu","Qiyuan Zhu","Ayden Yang","Kunyu Feng","Xinhua Zhang","Zhifeng Li","Sirui Han","Chenyang Qi","Qifeng Chen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05207"}

Training LLMs on openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books, encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially, we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2 7B.

While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \\textit{LLM Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with increased compute budget.

Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information. This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.","authors":["Jingyu Hu","Hongbo Bo","Jun Hong","Xiaowei Liu","Weiru Liu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05214"}

The robust loss function $\\mathcal{L}_\\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a robustness scaling parameter $\\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover, we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\\sigma$, the decentralized robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors) in both norms. The parameter $\\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.","authors":["Zhan Yu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05215"}

However, computing exact Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco & Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods, tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results compared to the KernelSHAP library.","authors":["Tyler Chen","Akshay Seshadri","Mattia J.

Many existing world modeling pipelines are based on implicit generative models, which are hard to train and often lack 3D or physical consistency. On the other hand, explicit 3D methods built from a single state often require multi-stage processing-such as segmentation, background completion, and inpainting-due to occlusions. To address this, we leverage two perturbed observations of the same scene under different object configurations. These dual states offer complementary visibility, alleviating occlusion issues during state transitions and enabling more stable and complete reconstruction. In this paper, we present DSG-World, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly constructs a 3D Gaussian World model from Dual State observations. Our approach builds dual segmentation-aware Gaussian fields and enforces bidirectional photometric and semantic consistency. We further introduce a pseudo intermediate state for symmetric alignment and design collaborative co-pruning trategies to refine geometric completeness. DSG-World enables efficient real-to-simulation transfer purely in the explicit Gaussian representation space, supporting high-fidelity rendering and object-level scene manipulation without relying on dense observations or multi-stage pipelines.

This design simplifies what would otherwise be a complex multi-tool pipeline (as in MinerU's modular approach) and avoids the inefficiencies of processing full pages with giant end-to-end models (e.g., large multimodal LLMs like Qwen-VL). In SRR, document parsing is abstracted into three fundamental questions - \"Where is it?\" (structure), \"What is it?\" (recognition), and \"How is it organized?\" (relation) - corresponding to layout analysis, content identification, and logical ordering. This focused decomposition balances accuracy and speed: it enables efficient, scalable processing without sacrificing precision. To train and evaluate this approach, we introduce the MonkeyDoc (the most comprehensive document parsing dataset to date), with 3.9 million instances spanning over ten document types in both Chinese and English. Experiments show that MonkeyOCR outperforms MinerU by an average of 5.1%, with particularly notable improvements on challenging content such as formulas (+15.0%) and tables (+8.6%). Remarkably, our 3B-parameter model surpasses much larger and top-performing models, including Qwen2.5-VL (72B) and Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieving state-of-the-art average performance on English document parsing tasks. In addition, MonkeyOCR processes multi-page documents significantly faster (0.84 pages per second compared to 0.65 for MinerU and 0.12 for Qwen2.5-VL-7B).

Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

To address these weaknesses, we propose the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"MesaNet: Sequence Modeling by Locally Optimal Test-Time Training","abstract":"Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet, Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective, approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding. This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network itself.","authors":["Johannes von Oswald","Nino Scherrer","Seijin Kobayashi","Luca Versari","Songlin Yang","Maximilian Schlegel","Kaitlin Maile","Yanick Schimpf","Oliver Sieberling","Alexander Meulemans","Rif A.

This is observed in many languages across the world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal, Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for its focus on functor-argument relations.

This language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Aligning Latent Spaces with Flow Priors","abstract":"This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.","authors":["Yizhuo Li","Yuying Ge","Yixiao Ge","Ying Shan","Ping Luo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05240"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"SECNEURON: Reliable and Flexible Abuse Control in Local LLMs via Hybrid Neuron Encryption","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities are increasingly being deployed in local environments, presenting significant security and controllability challenges. These locally deployed LLMs operate outside the direct control of developers, rendering them more susceptible to abuse. Existing mitigation techniques mainly designed for cloud-based LLM services are frequently circumvented or ineffective in deployer-controlled environments. We propose SECNEURON, the first framework that seamlessly embeds classic access control within the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, achieving reliable, cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs. SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to dynamically control the task-specific capabilities of LLMs, limiting unauthorized task abuse without compromising others. We first design a task-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons and construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. We then introduce a flexible and efficient hybrid encryption framework for millions of neurons in LLMs. Finally, we developed a distribution-based decrypted neuron detection mechanism on ciphertext to ensure the effectiveness of partially decrypted LLMs. We proved that SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle. Experiments on various task settings show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized task accuracy to below 25% while keeping authorized accuracy loss with 2%. Using an unauthorized Code task example, the accuracy of abuse-related malicious code generation was reduced from 59% to 15%. SECNEURON also mitigates unauthorized data leakage, reducing PII extraction rates to below 5% and membership inference to random guesses.","authors":["Zhiqiang Wang","Haohua Du","Junyang Wang","Haifeng Sun","Kaiwen Guo","Haikuo Yu","Chao Liu","Xiang-Yang Li"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05242"}

Since entailment classification is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit ``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end, we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition, (ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.","authors":["Ron Eliav","Arie Cattan","Eran Hirsch","Shahaf Bassan","Elias Stengel-Eskin","Mohit Bansal","Ido Dagan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05243"}

Despite this empirical success, the theoretical foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization. Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.","authors":["Zhen Qin","Jinxin Zhou","Zhihui Zhu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05249"}

To address this, we introduce MoViX, a self-supervised cross-view video localization framework that learns viewpoint- and season-invariant representations while preserving directional awareness essential for accurate localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal cues. A motion-informed frame sampler selects spatially diverse frames, and a lightweight temporal aggregator emphasizes geometrically aligned observations while downweighting ambiguous ones. At inference, MoViX runs within a Monte Carlo Localization framework, using a learned cross-view matching module in place of handcrafted models. Entropy-guided temperature scaling enables robust multi-hypothesis tracking and confident convergence under visual ambiguity. We evaluate MoViX on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on under 30 minutes of data and testing over 12.29 km. Despite outdated satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters of ground truth 93% of the time, and within 50 meters 100% of the time in unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without environment-specific tuning. We further demonstrate generalization on a real-world off-road dataset from a geographically distinct site with a different robot platform.","authors":["Zhiyun Deng","Dongmyeong Lee","Amanda Adkins","Jesse Quattrociocchi","Christian Ellis","Joydeep Biswas"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05250"}

These involve a variety of stakeholders: governments, businesses, advocates, and users. Their eventual deployment depends on the decision maker's ability to garner sufficient support from each of these groups; we formalize these strategic requirements from the perspective of cooperative game theory. Specifically, we introduce non-transferable utility, linear production (NTU LP) games, which combine the game-theoretic tensions inherent in public decision-making with the modeling flexibility of linear programming. We derive structural properties regarding the non-emptiness, representability and complexity of the core, a solution concept that models the viability of cooperation. In particular, we provide fairly general sufficient conditions under which the core of an NTU LP game is guaranteed to be non-empty, prove that determining membership in the core is co-NP-complete, and develop a cutting plane algorithm to optimize various social welfare objectives subject to core membership. Lastly, we apply these results in a data-driven case study on service plan optimization for the Chicago bus system. As our study illustrates, cooperation is necessary for the successful deployment of transportation service plans and similar public goods, but it may also have adverse or counterintuitive distributive implications.","authors":["J.

The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.","authors":["Dravyansh Sharma","Alec Sun"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05252"}

Existing solutions, including supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\\% without significantly dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines, ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.","authors":["Violet Xiang","Chase Blagden","Rafael Rafailov","Nathan Lile","Sang Truong","Chelsea Finn","Nick Haber"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05256"}

This calls for dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three \"forward passes\" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with sequence length reaching $\\sim 50k$.

However, the likelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_w\\mid x)$ and $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_l\\mid x) $ often decrease during training, inadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this paper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs, showing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video content. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean Preference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates the implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to the policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness correlated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses relevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the preference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain high-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus mitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label smoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse video content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of varying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO offers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with human trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient Video-LLMs.","authors":["Xiaodong Wang","Jinfa Huang","Li Yuan","Peixi Peng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05260"}

During the team formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance.

This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions, where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points, without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as well as moment estimation.","authors":["Selena Ling","Abhishek Madan","Nicholas Sharp","Alec Jacobson"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05268"}

Existing CoVR benchmarks emphasize appearance shifts or coarse event changes and therefore do not test the ability to capture subtle, fast-paced temporal differences. We introduce TF-CoVR, the first large-scale benchmark dedicated to temporally fine-grained CoVR. TF-CoVR focuses on gymnastics and diving and provides 180K triplets drawn from FineGym and FineDiving. Previous CoVR benchmarks focusing on temporal aspect, link each query to a single target segment taken from the same video, limiting practical usefulness. In TF-CoVR, we instead construct each  pair by prompting an LLM with the label differences between clips drawn from different videos; every pair is thus associated with multiple valid target videos (3.9 on average), reflecting real-world tasks such as sports-highlight generation. To model these temporal dynamics we propose TF-CoVR-Base, a concise two-stage training framework: (i) pre-train a video encoder on fine-grained action classification to obtain temporally discriminative embeddings; (ii) align the composed query with candidate videos using contrastive learning. We conduct the first comprehensive study of image, video, and general multimodal embedding (GME) models on temporally fine-grained composed retrieval in both zero-shot and fine-tuning regimes.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Stable Vision Concept Transformers for Medical Diagnosis","abstract":"Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer (VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field. To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer.

These applications necessitate persistent, context-aware understanding of objects, as users interact with tools in dynamic and cluttered environments. However, existing embodied benchmarks primarily focus on static scene exploration, emphasizing object's appearance and spatial attributes while neglecting the assessment of dynamic changes arising from users' interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EOC-Bench, an innovative benchmark designed to systematically evaluate object-centric embodied cognition in dynamic egocentric scenarios. Specially, EOC-Bench features 3,277 meticulously annotated QA pairs categorized into three temporal categories: Past, Present, and Future, covering 11 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and 3 visual object referencing types. To ensure thorough assessment, we develop a mixed-format human-in-the-loop annotation framework with four types of questions and design a novel multi-scale temporal accuracy metric for open-ended temporal evaluation. Based on EOC-Bench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of various proprietary, open-source, and object-level MLLMs. EOC-Bench serves as a crucial tool for advancing the embodied object cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, establishing a robust foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied systems.","authors":["Yuqian Yuan","Ronghao Dang","Long Li","Wentong Li","Dian Jiao","Xin Li","Deli Zhao","Fan Wang","Wenqiao Zhang","Jun Xiao","Yueting Zhuang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05287"}

However, existing image tokenizers encode tokens with bidirectional dependencies during the compression process, which hinders the effective modeling by autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Tokenizer (AliTok), which utilizes a causal decoder to establish unidirectional dependencies among encoded tokens, thereby aligning the token modeling approach between the tokenizer and autoregressive model. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing two-stage tokenizer training to enhance reconstruction consistency, AliTok achieves great reconstruction performance while being generation-friendly. On ImageNet-256 benchmark, using a standard decoder-only autoregressive model as the generator with only 177M parameters, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.50 and an IS of 305.9. When the parameter count is increased to 662M, AliTok achieves a gFID score of 1.35, surpassing the state-of-the-art diffusion method with 10x faster sampling speed.

However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.","authors":["Declan A.

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach $\\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10$\\times$ still leaves a performance gap.

Next, we present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback: it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from single-task to multi-task settings.

Approximate attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is based on our empirical observation that the $\\tau$-th quantile of attention scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps. Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when loading value vectors.","authors":["Nirav Koley","Prajwal Singhania","Abhinav Bhatele"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05300"}

In this work, we propose a one-step diffusion-based VR model, termed as SeedVR2, which performs adversarial VR training against real data. To handle the challenging high-resolution VR within a single step, we introduce several enhancements to both model architecture and training procedures. Specifically, an adaptive window attention mechanism is proposed, where the window size is dynamically adjusted to fit the output resolutions, avoiding window inconsistency observed under high-resolution VR using window attention with a predefined window size. To stabilize and improve the adversarial post-training towards VR, we further verify the effectiveness of a series of losses, including a proposed feature matching loss without significantly sacrificing training efficiency.

In contrast, many real-world settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous communication between LLM agents.

We introduce a new framework for learning \\emph{normalized} energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective, ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an energy network with this \\emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our energy model \\emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold.","authors":["Florentin Guth","Zahra Kadkhodaie","Eero P Simoncelli"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05310"}

Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss. This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through the dynamics of the dual variable.

We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.

With the integration with physics, it opens up new applications. The inverse problem of estimating physics from visual data, however, still remains challenging, limiting its effectiveness for applications like physically accurate digital twin creation in robotics and XR. Existing methods that incorporate physics into neural rendering frameworks typically require dense multi-view videos as input, making them impractical for scalable, real-world use. When presented with sparse multi-view videos, the sequential optimization strategy used by existing approaches introduces significant error accumulation, e.g., poor initial 3D reconstruction leads to bad material parameter estimation in subsequent stages. Instead of sequential optimization, directly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the highly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem.

Unlike 2D VLMs that typically process images through an image encoder, 3D scenes, with their intricate spatial structures, allow for diverse model architectures. Based on their encoder design, this paper categorizes recent 3D VLMs into 3D object-centric, 2D image-based, and 3D scene-centric approaches. Despite the architectural similarity of 3D scene-centric VLMs to their 2D counterparts, they have exhibited comparatively lower performance compared with the latest 3D object-centric and 2D image-based approaches. To understand this gap, we conduct an in-depth analysis, revealing that 3D scene-centric VLMs show limited reliance on the 3D scene encoder, and the pre-train stage appears less effective than in 2D VLMs. Furthermore, we observe that data scaling benefits are less pronounced on larger datasets. Our investigation suggests that while these models possess cross-modal alignment capabilities, they tend to over-rely on linguistic cues and overfit to frequent answer distributions, thereby diminishing the effective utilization of the 3D encoder. To address these limitations and encourage genuine 3D scene understanding, we introduce a novel 3D Relevance Discrimination QA dataset designed to disrupt shortcut learning and improve 3D understanding.

Existing works either adopt a similar textual reasoning for image input, or seek to interleave visual signals into mathematical CoT. However, they face three key limitations for math problem-solving: reliance on coarse-grained box-shaped image regions, limited perception of vision encoders on math content, and dependence on external capabilities for visual modification. In this paper, we propose MINT-CoT, introducing Mathematical INterleaved Tokens for Chain-of-Thought visual reasoning. MINT-CoT adaptively interleaves relevant visual tokens into textual reasoning steps via an Interleave Token, which dynamically selects visual regions of any shapes within math figures. To empower this capability, we construct the MINT-CoT dataset, containing 54K mathematical problems aligning each reasoning step with visual regions at the token level, accompanied by a rigorous data generation pipeline. We further present a three-stage MINT-CoT training strategy, progressively combining text-only CoT SFT, interleaved CoT SFT, and interleaved CoT RL, which derives our MINT-CoT-7B model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for effective visual interleaved reasoning in mathematical domains, where MINT-CoT-7B outperforms the baseline model by +34.08% on MathVista, +28.78% on GeoQA, and +23.2% on MMStar, respectively.

However, the scarcity of well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around 9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60 minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs, spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action, scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets, VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context.

Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g., Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to 32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS, attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor. Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training, where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve through increased generation.

However, analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn, fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the model's parametric knowledge.

Current video-based approaches, while proficient in tracking, lack the sophisticated reasoning capabilities of large language models, limiting their contextual understanding and generalization. We introduce VideoMolmo, a large multimodal model tailored for fine-grained spatio-temporal pointing conditioned on textual descriptions. Building upon the Molmo architecture, VideoMolmo incorporates a temporal module utilizing an attention mechanism to condition each frame on preceding frames, ensuring temporal consistency. Additionally, our novel temporal mask fusion pipeline employs SAM2 for bidirectional point propagation, significantly enhancing coherence across video sequences. This two-step decomposition, i.e., first using the LLM to generate precise pointing coordinates, then relying on a sequential mask-fusion module to produce coherent segmentation, not only simplifies the task for the language model but also enhances interpretability. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we curate a comprehensive dataset comprising 72k video-caption pairs annotated with 100k object points. To evaluate the generalization of VideoMolmo, we introduce VPoS-Bench, a challenging out-of-distribution benchmark spanning five real-world scenarios: Cell Tracking, Egocentric Vision, Autonomous Driving, Video-GUI Interaction, and Robotics. We also evaluate our model on Referring Video Object Segmentation (Refer-VOS) and Reasoning VOS tasks.

To achieve this, we first segment and remove furniture from the mesh representation, extend planes, and fill holes, obtaining a simplified defurnished mesh (SDM). This SDM acts as an ``X-ray'' of the scene's underlying structure, guiding the defurnishing process. We extract Canny edges from depth and normal images rendered from the SDM. We then use these as a guide to remove the furniture from panorama images via ControlNet inpainting. This control signal ensures the availability of global geometric information that may be hidden from a particular panoramic view by the furniture being removed. The inpainted panoramas are used to texture the mesh. We show that our approach produces higher quality assets than methods that rely on neural radiance fields, which tend to produce blurry low-resolution images, or RGB-D inpainting, which is highly susceptible to hallucinations.","authors":["Alan Dolhasz","Chen Ma","Dave Gausebeck","Kevin Chen","Gregor Miller","Lucas Hayne","Gunnar Hovden","Azwad Sabik","Olaf Brandt","Mira Slavcheva"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05338"}

This bias manifests as overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human = -0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%, while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.","authors":["Anirudh Bharadwaj","Chaitanya Malaviya","Nitish Joshi","Mark Yatskar"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05339"}

However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77) than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning.

In this work, we investigate how MLLMs process visual inputs by analyzing their attention mechanisms. We reveal a surprising sparsity phenomenon: only a small subset (approximately less than 5%) of attention heads in LLMs actively contribute to visual understanding, termed visual heads. To identify these heads efficiently, we design a training-free framework that quantifies head-level visual relevance through targeted response analysis. Building on this discovery, we introduce SparseMM, a KV-Cache optimization strategy that allocates asymmetric computation budgets to heads in LLMs based on their visual scores, leveraging the sparity of visual heads for accelerating the inference of MLLMs. Compared with prior KV-Cache acceleration methods that ignore the particularity of visual, SparseMM prioritizes stress and retaining visual semantics during decoding. Extensive evaluations across mainstream multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SparseMM achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression","abstract":"Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.","authors":["Adrian {\\L}a\\'ncucki","Konrad Staniszewski","Piotr Nawrot","Edoardo M.

However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails, making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.","authors":["Lei Hsiung","Tianyu Pang","Yung-Chen Tang","Linyue Song","Tsung-Yi Ho","Pin-Yu Chen","Yaoqing Yang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346"}

It requires interpreting fine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital text, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In such multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on selectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a rich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally extended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse mathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour. It requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand instructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and textual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality, totaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios, questions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem solving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual transfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep instructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended explanations and partially worked-out solutions.

CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.","authors":["Yang Tian","Fan Liu","Jingyuan Zhang","Victoria W.","Yupeng Hu","Liqiang Nie"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02544"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design","abstract":"We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza, anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result, structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.","authors":["Xinyan Zhao","Yi-Ching Tang","Akshita Singh","Victor J Cantu","KwanHo An","Junseok Lee","Adam E Stogsdill","Ashwin Kumar Ramesh","Zhiqiang An","Xiaoqian Jiang","Yejin Kim"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235"}

Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of victimization \"Group A\" models and then an introduction of demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called \"Group B\" models. The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention strategies.","authors":["Sydney Anuyah"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04240"}

Traditional measures of party system fragmentation, such as the Effective Number of Parties (ENP) index, often fail to capture the nuanced realities of African political landscapes, particularly the influence of dominant parties, fluid party affiliations, and the impact of ethnic and regional cleavages. To address these limitations, this paper introduces two novel \"apolitical\" or \"institutionally neutral\" measures for calculating the effective number of parties, focusing on geographical and demographic dimensions, notably population size and territorial area. By incorporating these local realities and ensuring a minimum threshold of two parties, the proposed models offer a simpler and more contextually relevant framework for understanding political dynamics in Africa, especially in data-scarce environments.

To address this limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased precision and interpretability.

This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Optical Physics-Based Generative Models","abstract":"This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz, dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with 20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus 1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy.

One place these effects can be observed is in how central or peripheral a researcher is in the coauthorship network. Here we investigate inequities in network centrality in a hand-collected data set of 5,670 U.S.-based faculty employed in Ph.D.-granting Computer Science departments and their DBLP coauthorship connections. We introduce algorithms for combining name- and perception-based demographic labels by maximizing alignment with self-reported demographics from a survey of faculty from our census. We find that women and individuals with minoritized race identities are less central in the computer science coauthorship network, implying worse access to and ability to spread information. Centrality is also highly correlated with prestige, such that faculty in top-ranked departments are at the core and those in low-ranked departments are in the peripheries of the computer science coauthorship network. We show that these disparities can be mitigated using simulated edge interventions, interpreted as facilitated collaborations. Our intervention increases the centrality of target individuals, chosen independently of the network structure, by linking them with researchers from highly ranked institutions. When applied to scholars during their Ph.D., the intervention also improves the predicted rank of their placement institution in the academic job market. This work was guided by an ameliorative approach: uncovering social inequities in order to address them. By targeting scholars for intervention based on institutional prestige, we are able to improve their centrality in the coauthorship network that plays a key role in job placement and longer-term academic success.","authors":["Kate Barnes","Mia Ellis-Einhorn","Carolina Ch\\'avez-Ruelas","Nayera Hasan","Mohammad Fanous","Blair D.

To simultaneously enhance privacy and training efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications. Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while opening up several future directions.

In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method.

Although these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold -- much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions -- such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide -- but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.","authors":["Salil Patel"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515"}

We show that including cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance across all cases.","authors":["Oliver G. S.

Many time discretization schemes for multiphase flow equations are either explicit or semi-implicit, relying on the decoupling between the saturation equation and the pressure equation. In this study, we delve into a fully coupled and fully implicit framework for simulating multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media, considering gravity and capillary effects. We utilize the Vertex-Centered Finite Volume Method for spatial discretization and propose an efficient implementation of interface conditions for heterogeneous porous media within the current scheme. Notably, we introduce the Linearly Implicit Extrapolation Method (LIMEX) with an error estimator, adapted for the first time to multiphase flow problems. To solve the resulting linear system, we employ the BiCGSTAB method with the Geometric Multigrid (GMG) preconditioner. The implementations of models and methods are based on the open-source software: UG4.

However, when all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP, we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings.

Traditional methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects. Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).

Unlike humans, these models learn language solely from textual data without directly interacting with the world. Yet they generate seemingly meaningful text on diverse topics. This achievement has renewed interest in the classical `Symbol Grounding Problem' -- the question of whether the internal representations and outputs of symbolic AI systems can possess intrinsic meaning that is not parasitic on external interpretation. Although modern LLMs compute over vectors rather than symbols, an analogous problem arises for these systems, which we call the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two main goals. First, we distinguish five main notions of grounding that are often conflated in the literature, and argue that only one of them, which we call referential grounding, is relevant to the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on philosophical theories of representational content, we provide two arguments for the claim that LLMs and related systems can achieve referential grounding: (1) through preference fine-tuning methods that explicitly establish world-involving functions, and (2) through pre-training alone, which in limited domains may select for internal states with world-involving content, as mechanistic interpretability research suggests. Through these pathways, LLMs can establish connections to the world sufficient for intrinsic meaning. One potentially surprising implication of our discussion is that that multimodality and embodiment are neither necessary nor sufficient to overcome the Grounding Problem.","authors":["Dimitri Coelho Mollo","Rapha\\\"el Milli\\`ere"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01481"}

Central to this task are soil hydraulic parameters, which govern moisture dynamics but are rarely known precisely and must therefore be inferred from observational data. In large-scale agricultural fields, estimating the complete set of these parameters is often impractical due to the sparse and noisy nature of available measurements. To address this challenge, this work develops a framework that uses sensitivity analysis and orthogonal projection to identify parameters that are both reliably estimable from available data. These parameters, together with the spatial distribution of soil moisture, are jointly estimated by assimilating observational data into a cylindrical-coordinate version of the Richards equation using an extended Kalman filter. The soil moisture measurements are obtained from microwave remote sensors mounted on center pivot irrigation systems - an emerging and practical technology for capturing field-scale variability. Numerical simulations and field experiments conducted on a large-scale site in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, demonstrate that the proposed method improves soil moisture estimation accuracy by 24-43% and enhances predictive model performance by 50%.

However, in the open ocean neither anchored farming nor floating farms with powerful engines are economically viable. Thus, a potential solution are farms that operate by going with the flow, utilizing minimal propulsion to strategically leverage beneficial ocean currents. In this work, we focus on low-power autonomous seaweed farms and design controllers that maximize seaweed growth by taking advantage of ocean currents. We first introduce a Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation to solve for the growth-optimal value function when the true currents are known. However, in reality only short-term imperfect forecasts with increasing uncertainty are available. Hence, we present three additional extensions. Firstly, we use frequent replanning to mitigate forecast errors. Second, to optimize for long-term growth, we extend the value function beyond the forecast horizon by estimating the expected future growth based on seasonal average currents. Lastly, we introduce a discounted finite-time DP formulation to account for the increasing uncertainty in future ocean current estimates. We empirically evaluate our approach with 30-day simulations of farms in realistic ocean conditions. Our method achieves 95.8\\% of the best possible growth using only 5-day forecasts.This demonstrates that low-power propulsion is a promising method to operate autonomous seaweed farms in real-world conditions.","authors":["Matthias Killer","Marius Wiggert","Hanna Krasowski","Manan Doshi","Pierre F.

It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.","authors":["Jie Li","Zhixin Li","Zhi Liu","Pengyuan Zhou","Richang Hong","Qiyue Li","Han Hu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462"}

We standardise existing proposals for nearest neighbour weighting with kernel functions, applied to the distance values and/or ranks of the nearest neighbours of a test instance. In particular, we show that the theoretically optimal Samworth weights converge to a kernel. Kernel functions are closely related to fuzzy negation operators, and we propose a new kernel based on Yager negation. We also consider various distance and scaling measures, which we show can be related to each other. Through a systematic series of experiments on 85 real-life classification datasets, we find that NN, FNN and FRNN all perform best with Boscovich distance, and that NN and FRNN perform best with a combination of Samworth rank- and distance-weights and scaling by the mean absolute deviation around the median ($r_1$), the standard deviation ($r_2$) or the semi-interquartile range ($r_{\\infty}^*$), while FNN performs best with only Samworth distance-weights and $r_1$- or $r_2$-scaling. However, NN achieves comparable performance with Yager-$\\frac{1}{2}$ distance-weights, which are simpler to implement than a combination of Samworth distance- and rank-weights. Finally, FRNN generally outperforms NN, which in turn performs systematically better than FNN.","authors":["Oliver Urs Lenz","Henri Bollaert","Chris Cornelis"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16872"}

However, as task complexity increases, LTL formulas become lengthy, making them difficult to interpret and generate, and straining the computational capacities of planners. To address this, we introduce a hierarchical structure for a widely used specification type -- LTL on finite traces (LTL$_f$). The resulting language, termed H-LTL$_f$, is defined with both its syntax and semantics. We further prove that H-LTL$_f$ is more expressive than its standard \"flat\" counterparts. Moreover, we conducted a user study that compared the standard LTL$_f$ with our hierarchical version and found that users could more easily comprehend complex tasks using the hierarchical structure. We develop a search-based approach to synthesize plans for multi-robot systems, achieving simultaneous task allocation and planning. This method approximates the search space by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, each corresponding to an LTL$_f$ specification. The search primarily focuses on a single sub-space, transitioning to another under conditions determined by the decomposition of automata. We develop multiple heuristics to significantly expedite the search. Our theoretical analysis, conducted under mild assumptions, addresses completeness and optimality.

To enhance coarse-grained knowledge transfer, we propose a novel framework called MT-Core (as shorthand for Multi-granularity knowledge Transfer for Continual reinforcement learning). MT-Core has a key characteristic of multi-granularity policy learning: 1) a coarsegrained policy formulation for utilizing the powerful reasoning ability of the large language model (LLM) to set goals, and 2) a fine-grained policy learning through RL which is oriented by the goals. We also construct a new policy library (knowledge base) to store policies that can be retrieved for multi-granularity knowledge transfer.

This work introduces ViewFusion, an end-to-end generative approach to novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an (inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target view only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2) adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely underdetermined conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of quality on par or even better than comparable methods.

Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.","authors":["Yuyao Ge","Shenghua Liu","Baolong Bi","Yiwei Wang","Lingrui Mei","Wenjie Feng","Lizhe Chen","Xueqi Cheng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07140"}

In the commonly studied domain of gender-occupation bias, we test whether these benchmarks are robust to lengthening the LLM responses as a measure of Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (i.e., RUTEd evaluations). From the current literature, we adapt three standard bias metrics (neutrality, skew, and stereotype) and develop analogous RUTEd evaluations from three contexts of real-world use: children's bedtime stories, user personas, and English language learning exercises. We find that standard bias metrics have no significant correlation with the more realistic bias metrics. For example, selecting the least biased model based on the standard \"trick tests\" coincides with selecting the least biased model as measured in more realistic use no more than random chance. We suggest that there is not yet evidence to justify standard benchmarks as reliable proxies of real-world AI biases, and we encourage further development of evaluations grounded in particular contexts.","authors":["Kristian Lum","Jacy Reese Anthis","Kevin Robinson","Chirag Nagpal","Alexander D'Amour"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12649"}

The current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in the form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation.

Our randomized test function circumvents the need for min-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Our method necessitates neither the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centers related to the generated data samples.

On a high level, the concept materializes all keys as triangles in a 3D scene and indexes them. Lookups are performed by firing rays into the scene and utilizing the index structure to detect hits in a hardware-accelerated fashion. While this approach called RTIndeX (or short RX) is indeed promising, it currently suffers from three limitations: (1) significant memory overhead per key, (2) slow range-lookups, and (3) poor updateability. In this work, we show that all three problems can be tackled by a single design change: Generalizing RX to become a coarse-granular index cgRX. Instead of indexing individual keys, cgRX indexes buckets of keys which are post-filtered after retrieval. This drastically reduces the memory overhead, leads to the generation of a smaller and more efficient index structure, and enables fast range-lookups as well as updates. We will see that representing the buckets in the 3D space such that the lookup of a key is performed both correctly and efficiently requires the careful orchestration of firing rays in a specific sequence. Our experimental evaluation shows that cgRX offers the most bang for the buck(et) by providing a throughput in relation to the memory footprint that is 1.5-3x higher than for the comparable range-lookup supporting baselines. At the same time, cgRX improves the range-lookup performance over RX by up to 2x and offers practical updateability that is up to 5.6x faster than rebuilding from scratch.","authors":["Justus Henneberg","Felix Schuhknecht","Rosina Kharal","Trevor Brown"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03965"}

However, posterior uncertainty estimates depend on the choice of prior, and finding informative priors in weight-space has proven difficult. This has motivated variational inference (VI) methods that pose priors directly on the function generated by the BNN rather than on weights. In this paper, we address a fundamental issue with such function-space VI approaches pointed out by Burt et al.

Our solution builds on generalized VI (Knoblauch et al., 2019) with the regularized KL divergence (Quang, 2019) and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first well-defined variational objective for function-space inference in BNNs with Gaussian process (GP) priors. Experiments show that our method incorporates the properties specified by the GP prior on synthetic and small real-world data sets, and provides competitive uncertainty estimates for regression, classification and out-of-distribution detection compared to BNN baselines with both function and weight-space priors.","authors":["Tristan Cinquin","Robert Bamler"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04317"}

Further, we show that these metrics are correlated with retrieval accuracy and similarity thresholds. Recent literature shows conflicting effects of isotropy on retrieval accuracies. Our experiments establish that the isotropy of embeddings (as measured by two independent state-of-the-art isotropy metric definitions) is poorly correlated with retrieval performance. We show that embeddings for domain-specific sentences have little overlap with those for domain-agnostic ones, and fine-tuning moves them further apart. Based on our results, we provide recommendations for use of our methodology and metrics by researchers and practitioners.","authors":["Sujoy Roychowdhury","Sumit Soman","Ranjani Hosakere Gireesha","Vansh Chhabra","Neeraj Gunda","Subhadip Bandyopadhyay","Sai Krishna Bala"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12336"}

However, despite being the fifth most-spoken language globally, Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in Bangla remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can be leveraged for improving Bangla GEC. For that, we first do an extensive categorization of 12 error classes in Bangla, and take a survey of native Bangla speakers to collect real-world errors. We next devise a rule-based noise injection method to create grammatically incorrect sentences corresponding to correct ones. The Vaiyakarana dataset, thus created, consists of 5,67,422 sentences of which 2,27,119 are erroneous. This dataset is then used to instruction-tune LLMs for the task of GEC in Bangla. Evaluations show that instruction-tuning with \\name improves GEC performance of LLMs by 3-7 percentage points as compared to the zero-shot setting, and makes them achieve human-like performance in grammatical error identification. Humans, though, remain superior in error correction.","authors":["Pramit Bhattacharyya","Arnab Bhattacharya"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14284"}

Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents DataGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. DataGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, DataGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by DataGen, and each module within DataGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, DataGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that DataGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.","authors":["Yue Huang","Siyuan Wu","Chujie Gao","Dongping Chen","Qihui Zhang","Yao Wan","Tianyi Zhou","Xiangliang Zhang","Jianfeng Gao","Chaowei Xiao","Lichao Sun"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18966"}

A typical choice to build a covariance function for a MOGP is the Linear Model of Coregionalization (LMC) which parametrically models the covariance between outputs. The Latent Variable MOGP (LV-MOGP) generalises this idea by modelling the covariance between outputs using a kernel applied to latent variables, one per output, leading to a flexible MOGP model that allows efficient generalization to new outputs with few data points. Computational complexity in LV-MOGP grows linearly with the number of outputs, which makes it unsuitable for problems with a large number of outputs.

However, concerns regarding copyright infringement arise as LLMs may inadvertently produce copyrighted material. In this paper, we first investigate the effectiveness of watermarking LLMs as a deterrent against the generation of copyrighted texts. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that incorporating watermarks into LLMs significantly reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted content, thereby addressing a critical concern in the deployment of LLMs. However, we also find that watermarking can have unintended consequences on Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to discern whether a sample was part of the pretraining dataset and may be used to detect copyright violations. Surprisingly, we find that watermarking adversely affects the success rate of MIAs, complicating the task of detecting copyrighted text in the pretraining dataset. These results reveal the complex interplay between different regulatory measures, which may impact each other in unforeseen ways. Finally, we propose an adaptive technique to improve the success rate of a recent MIA under watermarking.

At the same time, even frontier models remain vulnerable to jailbreaks and prompt injections, despite concerted efforts to make them robust. As both attack and defense gain access to more compute, and as models become larger, what happens to robustness? We argue that to answer this question requires a \\emph{scaling} approach, which we employ in an extensive study of language model robustness across several classification tasks, model families, and adversarial attacks. We find that in the absence of explicit safety training, larger models are not consistently more robust; however, scale improves sample efficiency in adversarial training, though it worsens compute efficiency. Further, we find that increasing attack compute smoothly improves attack success rate against both undefended and adversarially trained models. Finally, after exploring robustness transfer across attacks and threat models, we combine attack and defense scaling rates to study the offense-defense balance. We find that while attack scaling outpaces adversarial training across all models studied, larger adversarially trained models might give defense the advantage in the long run. These results underscore the utility of the scaling lens, and provide a paradigm for evaluating future attacks and defenses on frontier models.","authors":["Nikolaus Howe","Ian McKenzie","Oskar Hollinsworth","Micha{\\l} Zajac","Tom Tseng","Aaron Tucker","Pierre-Luc Bacon","Adam Gleave"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18213"}

However, significant aerial phase force (e.g., thrust and drag) can invalidate this assumption and lead to poor estimation performance. To combat this issue, a group has implemented multiple sensors (active and passive optical, inertial, and contact) and significant computational power to achieve full state estimation. This, however, poses a significant challenge to the development of light-weight, high-performance, low observable, jamming and electronic interference resistant hopping systems; especially in perceptually degraded environments (e.g., dust, smoke). Here we show a training procedure for a coupled hopping phase and Kalman filter-based vertical state estimator, requiring only inertial measurements, which is able to learn the characteristics of the target system, sensors, locomotion behaviors, environment, and acceleration measurement aliasing conditions. The resulting estimator, given hop heights up to 4 m and velocities up to $\\pm7$ m/s, achieves a mean absolute percent error in the hop apex height of 12.5% with an aerial trajectory average normalized mean absolute error in position and velocity of 19% and 16.5%, respectively; while operating at 840 Hz, on a dual-core 240 MHz processor, with a total robot mass of 672 g.

What is a robust procedure for using Transformers in abductive knowledge discovery within a mathematician-machine collaboration? In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based approach to computational enumerative geometry, specifically targeting the computation of $\\psi$-class intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves. By reformulating the problem as a continuous optimization task, we compute intersection numbers across a wide value range from $10^{-45}$ to $10^{45}$. To capture the recursive nature inherent in these intersection numbers, we propose the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA), a new activation function that enhances the Transformer's ability to model recursive patterns and handle severe heteroscedasticity. Given precision requirements for computing the intersections, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window adaptive to the partitions of equivalent number of marked points. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on modeling recursive functions with such a high-variance and factorial growth. Beyond simply computing intersection numbers, we explore the enumerative \"world-model\" of Transformers. Our interpretability analysis reveals that the network is implicitly modeling the Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Moreover, through abductive hypothesis testing, probing, and causal inference, we uncover evidence of an emergent internal representation of the the large-genus asymptotic of $\\psi$-class intersection numbers. These findings suggest that the network internalizes the parameters of the asymptotic closed-form and the polynomiality phenomenon of intersection numbers in a non-linear manner. This opens up new possibilities in inferring asymptotic closed-form expressions directly from limited amount of data.","authors":["Baran Hashemi","Roderic G.

Mainstream PEFT methods add a few trainable parameters while keeping the pre-trained backbone parameters fixed. These methods achieve comparative, and often superior, performance to fully fine-tuning, demonstrating the powerful representation ability of the pre-trained backbone. Despite this success, these methods typically ignore the initialization of the new parameters, often relying solely on random initialization. We argue that if pre-training is significantly beneficial, it should be applied to all parameters requiring representational capacity. Motivated by this, we propose Target Parameter Pre-training (TPP), a simple yet effective fine-tuning framework. TPP pre-trains target parameters, i.e., the new parameters introduced during fine-tuning, in an additional stage before PEFT. During this stage, the pre-trained backbone parameters are frozen, and only the new parameters are trainable. A defined pretext task encourages the new parameters to learn specific representations of downstream data. Subsequently, when PEFT is employed, the pre-trained new parameters are loaded to enhance fine-tuning efficiency. The proposed TPP framework is versatile, allowing integration with various pre-trained backbones, pretext tasks, and PEFT methods. We evaluated the fine-tuning performance of our method on seven public datasets, covering four modalities and two task types. The results demonstrate that TPP can be easily integrated into existing PEFT methods, significantly improving performance.","authors":["Xingliang Lei","Yiwen Ye","Zhisong Wang","Ziyang Chen","Minglei Shu","Weidong Cai","Yanning Zhang","Yong Xia"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15011"}

Additionally, to evaluate the severity in case of a significant drift, we provide an overview of the methods developed for classifier accuracy estimation in case of no access to ground truth labels. This should enable practitioners to implement methods ensuring reliable ML deployment and consistent prediction performance over time.","authors":["Mischa Dombrowski","Andrea Prenner","Bernhard Kainz"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17800"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Predicting memorization within Large Language Models fine-tuned for classification","abstract":"Large Language Models have received significant attention due to their abilities to solve a wide range of complex tasks. However these models memorize a significant proportion of their training data, posing a serious threat when disclosed at inference time. To mitigate this unintended memorization, it is crucial to understand what elements are memorized and why. This area of research is largely unexplored, with most existing works providing a posteriori explanations. To address this gap, we propose a new approach to detect memorized samples a priori in LLMs fine-tuned for classification tasks. This method is effective from the early stages of training and readily adaptable to other classification settings, such as training vision models from scratch. Our method is supported by new theoretical results, and requires a low computational budget. We achieve strong empirical results, paving the way for the systematic identification and protection of vulnerable samples before they are memorized.","authors":["J\\'er\\'emie Dentan","Davide Buscaldi","Aymen Shabou","Sonia Vanier"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18858"}

Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time.

One such method, Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI), uses conditional mutual information to encourage the connection between behavioral preferences and model responses. We conduct two experiments exploring SAMI in multi-task settings. First, we compare SAMI to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a multi-task benchmark (MT-Bench), using a stronger model to generate training data for a weaker one across diverse categories (humanities, STEM, extraction, coding, math, reasoning, and roleplay). Our results indicate that one iteration of SAMI has a 57% win rate against DPO, with significant variation in performance between task categories. Second, we examine SAMI's impact on mathematical accuracy (GSM-8K) relative to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While SAMI increases zero-shot performance by 1.1%, SFT is more effective with a 3.2% boost. However, SAMI shows interesting scaling trends. When given 10 attempts, SAMI improves accuracy by 3.9%, while SFT achieves a 10.1% increase. Combining SAMI with SFT yields an additional improvement of 1.3% in multi-attempt settings, though single-attempt accuracy remains unchanged.","authors":["Soham V.

However, annotating them is a tedious and sometimes impossible task. Consequently, current approaches for data modelling either ignore the higher-order interactions altogether or simplify them into pairwise connections. In order to facilitate higher-order processing, even when a hypergraph structure is not available, we introduce Structural Prediction using Hypergraph Inference Network (SPHINX), a model that learns to infer a latent hypergraph structure in an unsupervised way, solely from the final node-level signal. The model consists of a soft, differentiable clustering method used to sequentially predict, for each hyperedge, the probability distribution over the nodes and a sampling algorithm that converts them into an explicit hypergraph structure. We show that the recent advancement in $k$-subset sampling represents a suitable tool for producing discrete hypergraph structures, addressing some of the training instabilities exhibited by prior works. The resulting model can generate the higher-order structure necessary for any modern hypergraph neural network, facilitating the capture of higher-order interaction in domains where annotating them is difficult. Through extensive ablation studies and experiments conducted on two challenging datasets for trajectory prediction, we demonstrate that our model is capable of inferring suitable latent hypergraphs, that are interpretable and enhance the final performance.","authors":["Iulia Duta","Pietro Li\\`o"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03208"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Self-Correction is More than Refinement: A Learning Framework for Visual and Language Reasoning Tasks","abstract":"While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in visual and language reasoning tasks, they invariably generate flawed responses. Self-correction that instructs models to refine their outputs presents a promising solution to this issue. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on Large Language Models (LLMs), while the self-correction abilities of VLMs, particularly concerning both visual and linguistic information, remain largely unexamined. This study investigates the self-correction capabilities of VLMs during both inference and fine-tuning stages. We introduce a Self-Correction Learning (SCL) approach that enables VLMs to learn from their self-generated self-correction data through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) without relying on external feedback, facilitating self-improvement. Specifically, we collect preferred and disfavored samples based on the correctness of initial and refined responses, which are obtained by two-turn self-correction with VLMs during the inference stage. Experimental results demonstrate that although VLMs struggle to self-correct effectively during iterative inference without additional fine-tuning and external feedback, they can enhance their performance and avoid previous mistakes through preference fine-tuning when their self-generated self-correction data are categorized into preferred and disfavored samples. This study emphasizes that self-correction is not merely a refinement process; rather, it should enhance the reasoning abilities of models through additional training, enabling them to generate high-quality responses directly without further refinement.","authors":["Jiayi He","Hehai Lin","Qingyun Wang","Yi Fung","Heng Ji"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04055"}

While bias in models are well-documented, less is known about how these biases influence human decisions. This paper presents two interactive experiments investigating the effects of partisan bias in LLMs on political opinions and decision-making. Participants interacted freely with either a biased liberal, biased conservative, or unbiased control model while completing these tasks. We found that participants exposed to partisan biased models were significantly more likely to adopt opinions and make decisions which matched the LLM's bias. Even more surprising, this influence was seen when the model bias and personal political partisanship of the participant were opposite. However, we also discovered that prior knowledge of AI was weakly correlated with a reduction of the impact of the bias, highlighting the possible importance of AI education for robust mitigation of bias effects. Our findings not only highlight the critical effects of interacting with biased LLMs and its ability to impact public discourse and political conduct, but also highlights potential techniques for mitigating these risks in the future.","authors":["Jillian Fisher","Shangbin Feng","Robert Aron","Thomas Richardson","Yejin Choi","Daniel W.

The average certified radius (ACR) has emerged as a widely used metric for tracking progress in RS. However, in this work, for the first time we show that ACR is a poor metric for evaluating robustness guarantees provided by RS. We theoretically prove not only that a trivial classifier can have arbitrarily large ACR, but also that ACR is extremely sensitive to improvements on easy samples. In addition, the comparison using ACR has a strong dependence on the certification budget. Empirically, we confirm that existing training strategies, though improving ACR, reduce the model's robustness on hard samples consistently. To strengthen our findings, we propose strategies, including explicitly discarding hard samples, reweighing the dataset with approximate certified radius, and extreme optimization for easy samples, to replicate the progress in RS training and even achieve the state-of-the-art ACR on CIFAR-10, without training for robustness on the full data distribution. Overall, our results suggest that ACR has introduced a strong undesired bias to the field, and its application should be discontinued in RS. Finally, we suggest using the empirical distribution of $p_A$, the accuracy of the base model on noisy data, as an alternative metric for RS.","authors":["Chenhao Sun","Yuhao Mao","Mark Niklas M\\\"uller","Martin Vechev"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06895"}

Existing backdoor triggers are typically limited to fixed word patterns, making them detectable during data cleaning and easily removable post-poisoning. In this work, we explore the use of prompt-specific paraphrases as backdoor triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to removal during LLM alignment. We propose AdvBDGen, an adversarially fortified generative fine-tuning framework that automatically generates prompt-specific backdoors that are effective, stealthy, and transferable across models. AdvBDGen employs a generator-discriminator pair, fortified by an adversary, to ensure the installability and stealthiness of backdoors. It enables the crafting and successful installation of complex triggers using as little as 3% of the fine-tuning data. Once installed, these backdoors can jailbreak LLMs during inference, demonstrate improved stability against perturbations compared to traditional constant triggers, and are more challenging to remove. These findings underscore an urgent need for the research community to develop more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats in LLM alignment.","authors":["Pankayaraj Pathmanathan","Udari Madhushani Sehwag","Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess","Furong Huang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11283"}

Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness.

While humans exhibit compositional generalization and linguistic creativity in language use, the extent to which LLMs replicate these abilities, particularly in morphology, is under-explored. In this work, we systematically investigate the morphological generalization abilities of LLMs through the lens of compositionality.

Algorithmic fairness examines how a model's performance varies across socially relevant groups defined by protected attributes such as age, gender, or race. In this work, we explore the interplay between the performance gains from Deep Ensembles and fairness. Our analysis reveals that they unevenly favor different groups, a phenomenon that we term the disparate benefits effect. We empirically investigate this effect using popular facial analysis and medical imaging datasets with protected group attributes and find that it affects multiple established group fairness metrics, including statistical parity and equal opportunity. Furthermore, we identify that the per-group differences in predictive diversity of ensemble members can explain this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the classical Hardt post-processing method is particularly effective at mitigating the disparate benefits effect of Deep Ensembles by leveraging their better-calibrated predictive distributions.","authors":["Kajetan Schweighofer","Adrian Arnaiz-Rodriguez","Sepp Hochreiter","Nuria Oliver"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13831"}

In this paper, we introduce a formal estimation framework for isolated causal effects of language. We show that a core challenge of estimating isolated effects is the need to approximate all non-focal language outside of the intervention. Drawing on the principle of omitted variable bias, we provide measures for evaluating the quality of both non-focal language approximations and isolated effect estimates themselves. We find that poor approximation of non-focal language can lead to bias in the corresponding isolated effect estimates due to omission of relevant variables, and we show how to assess the sensitivity of effect estimates to such bias along the two key axes of fidelity and overlap. In experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world data, we validate the ability of our framework to correctly recover isolated effects and demonstrate the utility of our proposed measures.","authors":["Victoria Lin","Louis-Philippe Morency","Eli Ben-Michael"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14812"}

Across diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that FIT: (i) successfully steers behaviour at inference time; (ii) increases robustness by amplifying core task signals and down-weighting spurious cues; (iii) mitigates social bias by suppressing demographic attributes; and (iv) generalises under distribution shifts and to previously unseen focus features.

While signed distance also performs well on synthetic data, it performs substantially poorer on real-life datasets. We argue that this is a consequence of the fact that when using signed distance, low values of certain attributes automatically compensate for high values of other attributes, such that anomaly detection is reduced to counting the total attribute value sum, which is too simplistic in practice.","authors":["Oliver Urs Lenz","Matthijs van Leeuwen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23158"}

In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking. Our study strengthens fundamental understandings of LLM training and sheds novel insights on its efficiency and stability, which pave the way towards building a generalizable System-2 agent.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Failure Modes of LLMs for Causal Reasoning on Narratives","abstract":"In this work, we investigate the causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through the representative problem of inferring causal relationships from narratives. We find that even state-of-the-art language models rely on unreliable shortcuts, both in terms of the narrative presentation and their parametric knowledge. For example, LLMs tend to determine causal relationships based on the topological ordering of events (i.e., earlier events cause later ones), resulting in lower performance whenever events are not narrated in their exact causal order. Similarly, we demonstrate that LLMs struggle with long-term causal reasoning and often fail when the narratives are long and contain many events. Additionally, we show LLMs appear to rely heavily on their parametric knowledge at the expense of reasoning over the provided narrative. This degrades their abilities whenever the narrative opposes parametric knowledge. We extensively validate these failure modes through carefully controlled synthetic experiments, as well as evaluations on real-world narratives. Finally, we observe that explicitly generating a causal graph generally improves performance while naive chain-of-thought is ineffective. Collectively, our results distill precise failure modes of current state-of-the-art models and can pave the way for future techniques to enhance causal reasoning in LLMs.","authors":["Khurram Yamin","Shantanu Gupta","Gaurav R.

For ontologies in the Description Logic $\\mathcal{EL}^{++}$, several optimization-based embedding methods have been developed that explicitly generate models of an ontology. However, these methods suffer from some limitations; they do not distinguish between statements that are unprovable and provably false, and therefore they may use entailed statements as negatives. Furthermore, they do not utilize the deductive closure of an ontology to identify statements that are inferred but not asserted. We evaluated a set of embedding methods for $\\mathcal{EL}^{++}$ ontologies, incorporating several modifications that aim to make use of the ontology deductive closure. In particular, we designed novel negative losses that account both for the deductive closure and different types of negatives and formulated evaluation methods for knowledge base completion.

Yet, translating real-world problems into optimization models remains a difficult task, often demanding specialized expertise. This paper approaches the problem of $\\textit{autoformulation}$: the automated creation of solver-ready optimization models from natural language problem descriptions. We identify three core challenges of autoformulation: $\\textit{(1)}$ the vast, problem-dependent hypothesis space, $\\textit{(2)}$ efficient and diverse exploration of this space under uncertainty, and $\\textit{(3)}$ evaluation of formulation correctness against problem description. To address these challenges, we present a novel method leveraging $\\textit{Large Language Models}$ (LLMs) with $\\textit{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}$, exploiting the hierarchical nature of optimization modeling to generate and systematically explore possible formulations. To enhance search efficiency, we introduce symbolic pruning to eliminate trivially equivalent search paths (branches), and employ LLM-based evaluation of partial formulations to guide search.

For example, in the case of editing into s-clubs, the criterion is proximity since any pair of vertices (in an s-club) are within a distance of s from each other. In this work we consider the vertex splitting operation, which allows a vertex to belong to more than one cluster. This operation was studied as one of the parameters associated with the Cluster Editing problem. We study the complexity and parameterized complexity of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion with Vertex Splitting and s-Club Cluster Vertex Splitting problems. Both problems are shown to be NP-Complete and APX-hard. On the positive side, we show that both problems are Fixed-Parameter Tractable with respect to the number of allowed editing operations and that s-Club Cluster Vertex Splitting is solvable in polynomial-time on the class of forests.","authors":["Faisal N.

In this work we introduce FastDraft, a novel and efficient approach for pre-training and aligning a draft model to any large language model by incorporating efficient pre-training, followed by fine-tuning over synthetic datasets generated by the target model. We demonstrate FastDraft by training two highly parameter efficient drafts for the popular Phi-3-mini and Llama-3.1-8B models. Using FastDraft, we were able to produce a draft model with approximately 10 billion tokens on a single server with 8 Intel$^\\circledR$ Gaudi$^\\circledR$ 2 accelerators in under 24 hours. Our results show that the draft model achieves impressive results in key metrics of acceptance rate, block efficiency and up to 3x memory bound speed up when evaluated on code completion and up to 2x in summarization, text completion and instruction tasks. We validate our theoretical findings through benchmarking on the latest Intel$^\\circledR$ Core$^{\\tiny \\text{TM}}$ Ultra, achieving a wall-clock time speedup of up to 2x, indicating a significant reduction in runtime.

Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.","authors":["Andrew Kyle Lampinen","Stephanie C.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting","abstract":"Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

Traditional methods often face difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while complying with the inferred latent safety constraints. This is achieved by training an encoder with a reward-Advantage Weighted Regression objective within the latent constraint space. Our methodology is supported by theoretical analysis, including bounds on policy performance and sample complexity. Extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, including challenging autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrates that our approach not only maintains safety compliance but also excels in cumulative reward optimization, surpassing existing methods.

This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.","authors":["Shrisha Bharadwaj","Haiwen Feng","Giorgio Becherini","Victoria Abrevaya","Michael J.

However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.","authors":["Minghui Liu","Tahseen Rabbani","Tony O'Halloran","Ananth Sankaralingam","Mary-Anne Hartley","Furong Huang","Cornelia Ferm\\\"uller","Yiannis Aloimonos"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16187"}

Previous research has predominantly focused on a statistical model that extends the stochastic block model~(SBM) by incorporating additional group transformations. In its simplest form, the model randomly generates a network of size $n$ that consists of two equal-sized communities, where each node $i$ is associated with an unknown group element $g_i^* \\in G_M$ for some finite group $G_M$ of order $M$. The connectivity between nodes follows a probability $p$ if they belong to the same community, and a probability $q$ otherwise. Moreover, a group transformation $g_{ij} \\in G_M$ is observed on each edge $(i,j)$, where $g_{ij} = g_i^* - g_j^*$ if nodes $i$ and $j$ are within the same community, and $g_{ij} \\sim \\text{Uniform}(G_M)$ otherwise. The goal of the problem is to recover both the underlying communities and group elements. Under this setting, when $p = a\\log n /n$ and $q = b\\log n /n $ with $a, b > 0$, we establish the following sharp information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery by maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE): $$ (i):\\enspace \\frac{a + b}{2} -\\sqrt{\\frac{ab}{M}} > 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (ii):\\enspace a > 2$$ where the exact recovery of communities is possible only if $(i)$ is satisfied, and the recovery of group elements is achieved only if both $(i)$ and $(ii)$ are satisfied.

Connected vehicles (CVs) are given right-of-way based on prevailing traffic conditions, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs) of vehicles, the number of CVs in different approaches, and their emissions. These factors are considered in line with the objectives of the VTL application. Aiming to optimize traffic flow by reducing delays, VTL generates Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data for CVs approaching an intersection. Our VTL method considers the delay each CV would cause for other CVs if given the right-of-way. However, the stochastic nature of vehicle arrivals at intersections increases the complexity of the optimization problem, making it challenging for classical computers to determine optimal solutions in real-time. To address this limitation, we develop a VTL method designed to minimize stopped delays for CVs at an intersection by leveraging the efficacies of existing quantum computers that determine the best outcome from all possible combinations. This method employs Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a mathematical framework commonly used in quantum computing, to formulate the VTL problem as a stopped-delay-minimization challenge. To evaluate our method for roadway traffic with varying traffic volumes, we integrate an open-source microscopic roadway traffic simulator, Simulation for Urban Mobility (SUMO), with a cloud-based D-Wave quantum computer. Our analysis reveals that our quantum computing-supported VTL outperforms the classical optimization-based VTL by significantly reducing stopped delays at intersections and travel time through the roadway sections crossing the intersections.","authors":["Abyad Enan","M Sabbir Salek","Mashrur Chowdhury","Gurcan Comert","Sakib M.

To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, local score (LS) and equivariant local score (ELS) machines that, (3) after calibrating a single time-dependent hyperparameter can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.95, 0.94, 0.94, 0.96$ for our top model on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, MNIST, and CelebA). Our model reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic mechanism of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches at different scales and image locations.

This reliance typically leads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In this work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced performance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to predict accurately on atypical examples (minority groups) in the training set but failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper systematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small set of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that memorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three experimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of a small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information. Inspired by these findings, we hypothesize that spurious memorization, concentrated within a small subset of neurons, plays a key role in driving imbalanced group performance. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show that eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel framework during training can significantly affect the model performance on minority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and benchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious knowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness to spurious correlation.","authors":["Chenyu You","Haocheng Dai","Yifei Min","Jasjeet S.

Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints.

This model has surpassed existing deep learning approaches through experimental validation, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a sensitivity of 97%. By overlaying sensitivity maps onto lung Computed Tomography (CT) scans, it enables the visualization of regions most indicative of malignant or benign classifications. This innovative method demonstrates exceptional performance in distinguishing lung cancer with minimal false positives, thereby enhancing the accuracy of medical diagnoses.","authors":["Sugandha Saxena","S.

This step negatively affects key Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as time to first token (TTFT) and time per output token (TPOT). We introduce Encode-Prefill-Decode (EPD) Disaggregation, a novel framework that separates the encoding, prefill, and decode stages onto dedicated resources. Unlike current systems, which bundle encoding and prefill together, our approach decouples these steps, unlocking new opportunities and optimizations. These include a mechanism to cache multimedia tokens for efficient transfer, a novel way to parallelize the encoding load within a request, a module for optimal resource allocation for disaggregated serving, and a novel role-switching method to handle changing workload characteristics. Experimental evaluations with popular LMMs show substantial gains in memory efficiency (up to 15x lower peak memory utilization), batch sizes (up to 22x larger), 10x more images per request, and 2.2x larger KV caches. Furthermore, it leads to significant improvements in SLO attainment (up to 90-100% improvement) and TTFT (up to 71% reduction), compared to systems that do not disaggregate.

However, the development of effective PRMs faces significant challenges, particularly in data annotation and evaluation methodologies. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that commonly used Monte Carlo (MC) estimation-based data synthesis for PRMs typically yields inferior performance and generalization compared to LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation methods. MC estimation relies on completion models to evaluate current-step correctness, leading to inaccurate step verification. Furthermore, we identify potential biases in conventional Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation strategies for PRMs: (1) The unreliable policy models generate responses with correct answers but flawed processes, leading to a misalignment between the evaluation criteria of BoN and the PRM objectives of process verification. (2) The tolerance of PRMs of such responses leads to inflated BoN scores. (3) Existing PRMs have a significant proportion of minimum scores concentrated on the final answer steps, revealing the shift from process to outcome-based assessment in BoN Optimized PRMs. To address these challenges, we develop a consensus filtering mechanism that effectively integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge and advocates a more comprehensive evaluation framework that combines response-level and step-level metrics. Based on the mechanisms, we significantly improve both model performance and data efficiency in the BoN evaluation and the step-wise error identification task.

In the case of human behavior, face-to-face interaction networks enable us to understand the dynamics of how communities emerge and evolve in time through the interactions, which is crucial in fields like epidemics, sociological studies and urban science. However, state-of-the-art datasets suffer from a number of drawbacks, such as short time-span for data collection and a small number of participants. Moreover, concerns arise for the participants' privacy and the data collection costs. Over the past years, many successful algorithms for static networks generation have been proposed, but they often do not tackle the social structure of interactions or their temporal aspect. In this work, we extend a recent network generation approach to capture the evolution of interactions between different communities. Our method labels nodes based on their community affiliation and constructs surrogate networks that reflect the interactions of the original temporal networks between nodes with different labels. This enables the generation of synthetic networks that replicate realistic behaviors. We validate our approach by comparing structural measures between the original and generated networks across multiple face-to-face interaction datasets.","authors":["Nicol\\`o Alessandro Girardini","Antonio Longa","Gaia Trebucchi","Giulia Cencetti","Andrea Passerini","Bruno Lepri"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07327"}

Traditional approaches, which define vulnerabilities as weaknesses in computational logic or information systems, often overlook the physical and cyber-physical dimensions critical to manufacturing systems, comprising intertwined cyber, physical, and human elements. As a result, existing solutions fall short in addressing the complex, domain-specific vulnerabilities of manufacturing environments. To bridge this gap, this work redefines vulnerabilities in the manufacturing context by introducing a novel characterization based on the duality between vulnerabilities and defenses. Vulnerabilities are conceptualized as exploitable gaps within various defense layers, enabling a structured investigation of manufacturing systems. This paper presents a manufacturing-specific cyber-physical defense-in-depth model, highlighting how security-aware personnel, post-production inspection systems, and process monitoring approaches can complement traditional cyber defenses to enhance system resilience. Leveraging this model, we systematically identify and classify vulnerabilities across the manufacturing cyberspace, human element, post-production inspection systems, production process monitoring, and organizational policies and procedures. This comprehensive classification introduces the first taxonomy of cyber-physical vulnerabilities in smart manufacturing systems, providing practitioners with a structured framework for addressing vulnerabilities at both the system and process levels. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and framework is demonstrated through an illustrative smart manufacturing system and its corresponding threat model.","authors":["Md Habibor Rahman (University of Massachusetts Dartmouth)","Mohammed Shafae (The University of Arizona)"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09023"}

In this configuration, two encoders observe independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of a source random variable each and encode the inputs to the MAC. The decoder which observes the output of the MAC together with side-information, must generate approximately i.i.d. samples of another random variable which is jointly distributed with the two sources and the side information. We also allow for possible encoder cooperation, where one of the encoders can non-causally crib from the other encoders input. Independent pairwise shared randomness is assumed between each encoder and the decoder at limited rates. Firstly, in the presence of cribbing, we derive an achievable region based on joint source-channel coding. We also prove that in the absence of cribbing, our inner bound is tight for the special case when the MAC is composed of deterministic links, and the sources are conditionally independent given the side information. We then explicitly compute the regions for an example both with and without cribbing between the encoders, and demonstrate that cribbing strictly improves upon the achievable region.","authors":["Viswanathan Ramachandran","Tobias J.

To address this issue, we present FAS (Fast and Secure Federated Learning), a novel approach that strategically combines selective homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and bitwise scrambling to achieve robust security without compromising practical usability. Our approach eliminates the need for model pretraining phases while dynamically protecting high-risk model parameters through layered encryption and obfuscation. We implemented FAS using the Flower framework and evaluated it on a cluster of eleven physical machines. Our approach was up to 90\\% faster than applying FHE on the model weights.

Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals, as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving benefits of both signals.

Despite recent advances, deep neural networks still struggle to acquire this property reliably. In this work, we introduce CELEBI (Compressive-Expressive Language Emergence through a discrete Bottleneck and Iterated learning), a novel self-supervised framework for inducing compositionality in learned representations from pre-trained models, through a reconstruction-based communication game between a sender and a receiver. Building on theories of language emergence, we integrate three mechanisms that jointly promote compressibility, expressivity, and efficiency in the emergent language. First, interactive decoding incentivizes intermediate reasoning by requiring the receiver to produce partial reconstructions after each symbol. Second, a reconstruction-based imitation phase, inspired by iterated learning, trains successive generations of agents to imitate reconstructions rather than messages, enforcing a tighter communication bottleneck. Third, pairwise distance maximization regularizes message diversity by encouraging high distances between messages, with formal links to entropy maximization. Our method significantly improves both the efficiency and compositionality of the learned messages on the Shapes3D and MPI3D datasets, surpassing prior discrete communication frameworks in both reconstruction accuracy and topographic similarity.

Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant-curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3% over state-of-the-art models.

Promising empirical results revealed that a strong model can surpass its weak supervisor. While recent work has offered theoretical insights into this phenomenon, a clear understanding of the interactions between weak and strong models that drive W2SG remains elusive. We investigate W2SG through a theoretical lens and show that it can be characterized using kernels derived from the principal components of weak and strong models' internal representations. These kernels can be used to define a space that, at a high level, captures what the weak model is unable to learn but is learnable by the strong model. The projection of labels onto this space quantifies how much the strong model falls short of its full potential due to weak supervision. This characterization also provides insights into how certain errors in weak supervision can be corrected by the strong model, regardless of overfitting.

In response to this problem, this work conducts a thorough study about serving LLMs over heterogeneous GPU resources on cloud platforms. The rationale is that different GPU types exhibit distinct compute and memory characteristics, aligning well with the divergent resource demands of diverse requests. Particularly, through comprehensive benchmarking, we discover that the cost-efficiency of LLM serving can be substantially optimized by meticulously determining GPU composition, deployment configurations, and workload assignments. Subsequently, we design a scheduling algorithm via mixed-integer linear programming, aiming at deducing the most cost-efficient serving plan under the constraints of price budget and real-time GPU availability.

We focus on scenarios where the model is over-parameterized for flexibility while the approximate posterior is chosen to be Gaussian with isotropic covariance for tractability, even though it cannot match the true posterior exactly. In such scenarios, we find the ELBo prioritizes posteriors that match the prior variance, which leads to severely underfitting the data. Instead, we recommend a data-emphasized ELBo that upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior.

To meet the demands for safety, reliability, and controllability in HD-WMRs, the control system must tolerate faults to a certain extent, ensuring continuous operation. To this end, this paper introduces a model-free hierarchical control with fault accommodation (MFHCA) framework designed to address sensor and actuator faults in hydraulically powered HD-WMRs with independently controlled wheels. To begin, a novel mathematical representation of the motion dynamics of HD-WMRs, incorporating both sensor and actuator fault modes, is investigated.

To do so, this framework generates appropriate power efforts in independently valve-regulated wheels to accommodate the adaptively isolated faults, thereby ensuring exponential stability.

This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient.

In the feature space, different local regions within an individual global feature map often encode distinct yet interdependent semantic information. However, previous methods mainly focus on transferring global feature knowledge, neglecting the decoupling of interdependent local regions within an individual global feature, which often results in suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose MSDCRD, a novel contrastive representation distillation approach that explicitly performs multi-scale decoupling within the feature space. MSDCRD employs a multi-scale sliding-window pooling approach within the feature space to capture representations at various granularities effectively. This, in conjunction with sample categorization, facilitates efficient multi-scale feature decoupling. When integrated with a novel and effective contrastive loss function, this forms the core of MSDCRD. Feature representations differ significantly across network architectures, and this divergence becomes more pronounced in heterogeneous models, rendering feature distillation particularly challenging. Despite this, our method not only achieves superior performance in homogeneous models but also enables efficient feature knowledge transfer across a variety of heterogeneous teacher-student pairs, highlighting its strong generalizability. Moreover, its plug-and-play and parameter-free nature enables flexible integration with different visual tasks.

This paper unravels for the first time the trajectories of distributed optimization from resilience to vulnerability, and finally to collapse under varying adversary influence. Using real-world data to emulate over 28 billion multi-agent optimization scenarios, we exhaustively assess how the number of agents with different adversarial severity and network positioning influences optimization performance, including the influence on Pareto optimal points. With this novel large-scale dataset, made openly available as a benchmark, we disentangle how optimization remains resilient to adversaries and which adversary conditions are required to make optimization vulnerable or collapsed. These new findings can provide new insights for designing self-healing strategies for fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization that have been missing so far.","authors":["Amal Aldawsari","Evangelos Pournaras"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05954"}

It is currently possible to train in FP8 only if one is willing to tune various hyperparameters, reduce model scale, or accept the overhead of computing dynamic scale factors. We demonstrate simple, scalable FP8 training that requires no dynamic scaling factors or special hyperparameters, even at large model sizes. Our method, $\\mu$nit Scaling ($\\mu$S), also enables simple hyperparameter transfer across model widths, matched numerics across training and inference, and other desirable properties. $\\mu$nit Scaling is straightforward to implement, consisting of a set of minimal interventions based on a first-principles analysis of common transformer operations.

In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, an efficiently computable policy achieves an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in the long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our main technical innovation is the construction of projection-based Lyapunov functions that certify the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region, even under full heterogeneity.","authors":["Xiangcheng Zhang","Yige Hong","Weina Wang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06072"}

This work presents inflatable kirigami crawlers created by introducing cut patterns into heat-sealable textiles to achieve locomotion upon cyclic pneumatic actuation. Inflating traditional air pouches results in symmetric bulging and contraction. In inflated kirigami actuators, the accumulated compressive forces uniformly break the symmetry, enhance contraction compared to simple air pouches by two folds, and trigger local rotation of the sealed edges that overlap and self-assemble into an architected surface with emerging scale-like features. As a result, the inflatable kirigami actuators exhibit a uniform, controlled contraction with asymmetric localized out-of-plane deformations. This process allows us to harness the geometric and material nonlinearities to imbue inflatable textile-based kirigami actuators with predictable locomotive functionalities. We thoroughly characterized the programmed deformations of these actuators and their impact on friction. We found that the kirigami actuators exhibit directional anisotropic friction properties when inflated, having higher friction coefficients against the direction of the movement, enabling them to move across surfaces with varying roughness. We further enhanced the functionality of inflatable kirigami actuators by introducing multiple channels and segments to create functional soft robotic prototypes with versatile locomotion capabilities.","authors":["Burcu Seyido\\u{g}lu","Aida Parvaresh","Bahman Taherkhani","Ahmad Rafsanjani"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06466"}

Reconstruction-based graph anomaly detection (GAD) methods overlook such geometric outliers, focusing only on structural and attribute-level anomalies. To this end, we propose CurvGAD - a mixed-curvature graph autoencoder that introduces the notion of curvature-based geometric anomalies. CurvGAD introduces two parallel pipelines for enhanced anomaly interpretability: (1) Curvature-equivariant geometry reconstruction, which focuses exclusively on reconstructing the edge curvatures using a mixed-curvature, Riemannian encoder and Gaussian kernel-based decoder; and (2) Curvature-invariant structure and attribute reconstruction, which decouples structural and attribute anomalies from geometric irregularities by regularizing graph curvature under discrete Ollivier-Ricci flow, thereby isolating the non-geometric anomalies. By leveraging curvature, CurvGAD refines the existing anomaly classifications and identifies new curvature-driven anomalies.

A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.","authors":["Qiwei Wang","Shaoxun Wu","Yujiao Shi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09080"}

In each round of the interaction, the learner observes feedback consisting of the predicted labels which lie in some underlying set of ground truth labels associated with the given example. Our main result is for the $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-PAC variant of the problem for which we design an algorithm that returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal hypothesis with high probability using a sample complexity of $\\widetilde{O} \\big( (\\mathrm{poly}(K/m) + sm / \\varepsilon^2) \\log (|H|/\\delta) \\big)$ where $H$ is the underlying (finite) hypothesis class and $s$ is an upper bound on the number of true labels for a given example.

Moreover, in the regime where $s = O(1)$ the leading terms in our bound match the corresponding full-information rates, implying that bandit feedback essentially comes at no cost. Our PAC learning algorithm is also computationally efficient given access to an ERM oracle for $H$. In the special case of single-label classification corresponding to $s=m=1$, we prove a sample complexity bound of $O \\big((K^7 + 1/\\varepsilon^2)\\log (|H|/\\delta)\\big)$ which improves upon recent results in this scenario (Erez et al.

However, the underlying mechanisms of these initializations remain unclear, and attacks utilize arbitrary or hand-picked initializations. This work presents that each gradient-based jailbreak attack and subsequent initialization gradually converge to a single compliance direction that suppresses refusal, thereby enabling an efficient transition from refusal to compliance.

Our evaluation reveals that explicitly incorporating distractors can substantially mitigate miscalibration, achieving relative accuracy improvements up to 460% and ECE reductions up to 90%. Despite general trends, we uncover nuanced findings: large RLHF-tuned models display inherent calibration strengths but can paradoxically suffer increased miscalibration on easier queries, whereas smaller models benefit disproportionately from distractor prompts but remain significantly miscalibrated. Through detailed analyses across question types, we identify persistent calibration failures, particularly in person-based queries.

While recent advances in Offline Multi-Agent RL (MARL) have shown promise, most existing methods either rely on large datasets jointly collected by all agents or agent-specific datasets collected independently. The former approach ensures strong performance but raises scalability concerns, while the latter emphasizes scalability at the expense of performance guarantees. In this work, we propose a novel scalable routine for both dataset collection and offline learning. Agents first collect diverse datasets coherently with a pre-specified information-sharing network and subsequently learn coherent localized policies without requiring either full observability or falling back to complete decentralization. We theoretically demonstrate that this structured approach allows a multi-agent extension of the seminal Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI) algorithm to globally converge, in high probability, to near-optimal policies. The convergence is subject to error terms that depend on the informativeness of the shared information. Furthermore, we show how this approach allows to bound the inherent error of the supervised-learning phase of FQI with the mutual information between shared and unshared information. Our algorithm, SCAlable Multi-agent FQI (SCAM-FQI), is then evaluated on a distributed decision-making problem. The empirical results align with our theoretical findings, supporting the effectiveness of SCAM-FQI in achieving a balance between scalability and policy performance.","authors":["Riccardo Zamboni","Enrico Brunetti","Marcello Restelli"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11260"}

While numerous LoRA variants have been proposed to improve performance by addressing one of these aspects, they often compromise usability or computational efficiency. In this paper, we analyze and identify the core limitations of existing approaches and propose a novel framework -- GoRA (Gradient-driven Adaptive Low Rank Adaptation) -- that simultaneously adapts both the rank and initialization strategy within a unified framework. GoRA leverages gradient information during training to dynamically assign optimal ranks and initialize low-rank adapter weights in an adaptive manner. To our knowledge, GoRA is the first method that not only addresses the limitations of prior approaches -- which often focus on either rank selection or initialization in isolation -- but also unifies both aspects within a single framework, enabling more effective and efficient adaptation. Extensive experiments across various architectures and modalities show that GoRA consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based methods while preserving the efficiency of vanilla LoRA.

Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and aviation, where errors can have severe consequences.

These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design.","authors":["Yuri Kuratov","Mikhail Arkhipov","Aydar Bulatov","Mikhail Burtsev"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13063"}

By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research.","authors":["Keane Ong","Rui Mao","Deeksha Varshney","Erik Cambria","Gianmarco Mengaldo"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15821"}

In this work, we introduce AnyTop, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"SNaRe: Domain-aware Data Generation for Low-Resource Event Detection","abstract":"Event Detection (ED) -- the task of identifying event mentions from natural language text -- is critical for enabling reasoning in highly specialized domains such as biomedicine, law, and epidemiology. Data generation has proven to be effective in broadening its utility to wider applications without requiring expensive expert annotations. However, when existing generation approaches are applied to specialized domains, they struggle with label noise, where annotations are incorrect, and domain drift, characterized by a distributional mismatch between generated sentences and the target domain. To address these issues, we introduce SNaRe, a domain-aware synthetic data generation framework composed of three components: Scout, Narrator, and Refiner. Scout extracts triggers from unlabeled target domain data and curates a high-quality domain-specific trigger list using corpus-level statistics to mitigate domain drift. Narrator, conditioned on these triggers, generates high-quality domain-aligned sentences, and Refiner identifies additional event mentions, ensuring high annotation quality. Experimentation on three diverse domain ED datasets reveals how SNaRe outperforms the best baseline, achieving average F1 gains of 3-7% in the zero-shot/few-shot settings and 4-20% F1 improvement for multilingual generation. Analyzing the generated trigger hit rate and human evaluation substantiates SNaRe's stronger annotation quality and reduced domain drift.","authors":["Tanmay Parekh","Yuxuan Dong","Lucas Bandarkar","Artin Kim","I-Hung Hsu","Kai-Wei Chang","Nanyun Peng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17394"}

Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for complex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step analysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs like OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level performance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the deliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities. This survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs and the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their combination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to construct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling advanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally, we provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison of the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time \\href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub Repository} to track the latest developments.

Domain-specific knowledge gaps in training also make them prone to confusing visually similar, commonly misrepresented, or low-resource concepts. To help LMMs better align nuanced visual features with language, improving their ability to recognize and reason about novel or rare concepts, we propose a Contrastive visual Data Augmentation (CoDA) strategy. CoDA extracts key contrastive textual and visual features of target concepts against the known concepts they are misrecognized as, and then uses multimodal generative models to produce targeted synthetic data. Automatic filtering of extracted features and augmented images is implemented to guarantee their quality, as verified by human annotators. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDA on low-resource concept and diverse scene recognition datasets including INaturalist and SUN. We additionally collect NovelSpecies, a benchmark dataset consisting of newly discovered animal species that are guaranteed to be unseen by LMMs. LLaVA-1.6 1-shot updating results on these three datasets show CoDA significantly improves SOTA visual data augmentation strategies by 12.3% (NovelSpecies), 5.1% (SUN), and 6.0% (iNat) absolute gains in accuracy.","authors":["Yu Zhou","Bingxuan Li","Mohan Tang","Xiaomeng Jin","Te-Lin Wu","Kuan-Hao Huang","Heng Ji","Kai-Wei Chang","Nanyun Peng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17709"}

Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics.

However, its performance often degrades under distribution shifts, especially those altering network connectivity. Current methods to address these shifts typically require retraining with the source dataset, which is often infeasible due to computational or privacy limitations. We introduce Test-Time Structural Alignment (TSA), a novel algorithm for Graph Test-Time Adaptation (GTTA) that aligns graph structures during inference without accessing the source data. Grounded in a theoretical understanding of graph data distribution shifts, TSA employs three synergistic strategies: uncertainty-aware neighborhood weighting to accommodate neighbor label distribution shifts, adaptive balancing of self-node and aggregated neighborhood representations based on their signal-to-noise ratio, and decision boundary refinement to correct residual label and feature shifts. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate TSA's consistent outperformance of both non-graph TTA methods and state-of-the-art GTTA baselines.","authors":["Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu","Shikun Liu","Han Zhao","Pan Li"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18334"}

We focus on scenarios where an attacker compromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned outcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious malicious prompts - the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To mitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two \"vaccination\" approaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into the agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction strategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious instructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability in the agent network.

The discovered trade-off, which we name Safety Tax, should shed light on future endeavors of safety research on LRMs. As a by-product, we curate a dataset called DirectRefusal, which might serve as an alternative dataset for safety alignment.

Existing agent tuning approaches typically employ supervised finetuning on entire expert trajectories. However, behavior-cloning of full trajectories can introduce expert bias and weaken generalization to states not covered by the expert data. Additionally, critical steps, such as planning, complex reasoning for intermediate subtasks, and strategic decision-making, are essential to success in agent tasks, so learning these steps is the key to improving LLM agents. For more effective and efficient agent tuning, we propose ATLaS that identifies the critical steps in expert trajectories and finetunes LLMs solely on these steps with reduced costs. By steering the training's focus to a few critical steps, our method mitigates the risk of overfitting entire trajectories and promotes generalization across different environments and tasks. In extensive experiments, an LLM finetuned on only 30% critical steps selected by ATLaS outperforms the LLM finetuned on all steps and recent open-source LLM agents.

However, as users interact with claims online, they often introduce edits, and it remains unclear whether current embedding models used in retrieval are robust to such edits. To investigate this, we introduce a perturbation framework that generates valid and natural claim variations, enabling us to assess the robustness of a wide-range of sentence embedding models in a multi-stage retrieval pipeline and evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation approaches. Our evaluation reveals that standard embedding models exhibit notable performance drops on edited claims, while LLM-distilled embedding models offer improved robustness at a higher computational cost. Although a strong reranker helps to reduce the performance drop, it cannot fully compensate for first-stage retrieval gaps. To address these retrieval gaps, we evaluate train- and inference-time mitigation approaches, demonstrating that they can improve in-domain robustness by up to 17 percentage points and boost out-of-domain generalization by 10 percentage points.

This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.","authors":["Anthony Frion (Lab-STICC\\_OSE","IMT Atlantique - MEE)","Lucas Drumetz (IMT Atlantique - MEE","Lab-STICC\\_OSE)","Mauro Dalla Mura (GIPSA-SIGMAPHY)","Guillaume Tochon (GIPSA-SIGMAPHY)","Abdeldjalil A\\\"issa-El-Bey (IMT Atlantique - MEE","Lab-STICC\\_COSYDE)"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12930"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Assessing AI Explainability: A Usability Study Using a Novel Framework Involving Clinicians","abstract":"An AI design framework was developed based on three core principles, namely understandability, trust, and usability. The framework was conceptualized by synthesizing evidence from the literature and by consulting with experts. The initial version of the AI Explainability Framework was validated based on an in-depth expert engagement and review process. For evaluation purposes, an AI-anchored prototype, incorporating novel explainability features, was built and deployed online. The primary function of the prototype was to predict the postpartum depression risk using analytics models. The development of the prototype was carried out in an iterative fashion, based on a pilot-level formative evaluation, followed by refinements and summative evaluation. The System Explainability Scale (SES) metric was developed to measure the influence of the three dimensions of the AI Explainability Framework. For the summative stage, a comprehensive usability test was conducted involving 20 clinicians, and the SES metric was used to assess clinicians` satisfaction with the tool. On a 5-point rating system, the tool received high scores for the usability dimension, followed by trust and understandability. The average explainability score was 4.56. In terms of understandability, trust, and usability, the average score was 4.51, 4.53 and 4.71 respectively. Overall, the 13-item SES metric showed strong internal consistency with Cronbach`s alpha of 0.84 and a positive correlation coefficient (Spearman`s rho = 0.81, p<0.001) between the composite SES score and explainability. A major finding was that the framework, combined with the SES usability metric, provides a straightforward approach for developing AI-based healthcare tools that lower the challenges associated with explainability.","authors":["Mohammad Golam Kibria","Lauren Kucirka","Javed Mostafa"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16920"}

In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-6})$.

Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.","authors":["Dvir Samuel","Matan Levy","Nir Darshan","Gal Chechik","Rami Ben-Ari"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18033"}

To facilitate applications where only partial surface information is available, or scanning is performed sequentially, a recent line of work proposes to incorporate uncertainty into the reconstructed surface via Gaussian process models. The resulting algorithms first perform Gaussian process interpolation, then solve a set of volumetric partial differential equations globally in space, resulting in a computationally expensive two-stage procedure. In this work, we apply recently-developed techniques from geometric Gaussian processes to combine interpolation and surface reconstruction into a single stage, requiring only one linear solve per sample. The resulting reconstructed surface samples can be queried locally in space, without the use of problem-dependent volumetric meshes or grids. These capabilities enable one to (a) perform probabilistic collision detection locally around the region of interest, (b) perform ray casting without evaluating points not on the ray's trajectory, and (c) perform next-view planning on a per-ray basis. They also do not requiring one to approximate kernel matrix inverses with diagonal matrices as part of intermediate computations, unlike prior methods.

We introduce GarmageNet, a unified generative framework that automates the creation of 2D sewing patterns, the construction of sewing relationships, and the synthesis of 3D garment initializations compatible with physics-based simulation. Central to our approach is Garmage, a novel garment representation that encodes each panel as a structured geometry image, effectively bridging the semantic and geometric gap between 2D structural patterns and 3D garment shapes. GarmageNet employs a latent diffusion transformer to synthesize panel-wise geometry images and integrates GarmageJigsaw, a neural module for predicting point-to-point sewing connections along panel contours. To support training and evaluation, we build GarmageSet, a large-scale dataset comprising over 10,000 professionally designed garments with detailed structural and style annotations. Our method demonstrates versatility and efficacy across multiple application scenarios, including scalable garment generation from multi-modal design concepts (text prompts, sketches, photographs), automatic modeling from raw flat sewing patterns, pattern recovery from unstructured point clouds, and progressive garment editing using conventional instructions-laying the foundation for fully automated, production-ready pipelines in digital fashion.

While progress in data selection continues, emerging applications require studying this problem in dynamic contexts. To bridge this gap, we pose the Incremental Data Selection (IDS) problem, where examples arrive as a continuous stream, and need to be selected without access to the full data source. In this setting, the learner must incrementally build a training dataset of predefined size while simultaneously learning the underlying task. We find that in IDS, the impact of a new sample on the model state depends fundamentally on both its geometric relationship in the feature space and its prediction error. Leveraging this insight, we propose PEAKS (Prediction Error Anchored by Kernel Similarity), an efficient data selection method tailored for IDS. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PEAKS consistently outperforms existing selection strategies. Furthermore, PEAKS yields increasingly better performance returns than random selection as training data size grows on real-world datasets.

This extension can benefit all DNS clients - especially Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This is important because even resource-constrained IoT devices can generate dozens of DNS requests every hour. DNS is a crucial service that correlates IP addresses and domain names. It is traditionally sent as plain-text, favoring low-latency results over security and privacy. The repercussion of this can be eavesdropping and information leakage about IoT devices. To address these concerns, the newest and most promising solution is DoQ. QUIC offers features similar to TCP and TLS while also supporting early data delivery and stream multiplexing. DoQ's specification requires that DNS exchanges occur over independent streams in a long-lived QUIC connection. Our hypothesis is that due to DNS's typically high transaction volume, managing QUIC streams may be overly resource intensive for IoT devices. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a data delivery mode for DoQ using QUIC datagrams, which we believe to be more preferable than stream-based delivery. To test our theory, we analyzed the memory, CPU, signaling, power, and time of each DoQ delivery mode in a setup generating real queries and network traffic. Our novel datagram-based delivery mode proved to be decisively more resource-friendly with little compromise in terms of functionality or performance. Furthermore, our paper is the first to investigate multiple queries over DoQ, to our knowledge.","authors":["Darius Saif","Ashraf Matrawy"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09200"}

However, general-purpose models fail to generalize well when applied directly to fine-grained audio domains. Specifically, bird-sound classification requires distinguishing subtle inter-species differences and managing high intra-species acoustic variability, thereby revealing the performance limitations of general-domain Audio-MAE models. This work demonstrates that bridging this domain gap requires more than domain-specific pretraining data; adapting the entire training pipeline is crucial. We systematically revisit and adapt the pretraining recipe, fine-tuning methods, and frozen feature utilization to bird sounds using BirdSet, a large-scale bioacoustic dataset comparable to AudioSet.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Calibrating Translation Decoding with Quality Estimation on LLMs","abstract":"Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method, translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code and human evaluation data, has been released to the community: https://github.com/moore3930/calibrating-llm-mt.","authors":["Di Wu","Yibin Lei","Christof Monz"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19044"}

Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage.

To optimize this process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model, CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors by 2.8$\\times$ for latency and 3.4$\\times$ for resource utilization compared to baseline models.","authors":["Lei Xu","Shanshan Wang","Emmanuel Casseau","Chenglong Xiao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649"}

The LDL factorization is a common tool for factorization of symmetric matrices, and, unlike orthogonal counterparts, generalizes to an arbitrary field. We provide algorithms for dense and sparse LDL nd LU factorization that aim to minimize complexity for factorization over a general field. For LDL of an $n\\times n$ matrix, we give an algorithm with complexity $O(n^\\omega)$, where the complexity of $n\\times n$ matrix multiplication is assumed to be $O(n^\\omega)$ with $\\omega>2$. For sparse matrices corresponding to graphs with treewidth $\\tau$, we give an algorithm with complexity $O(n\\tau^{\\omega-1})$, to compute an LDL an implicit form, or the explicit LDL if the matrix is near full rank. Our sparse LDL algorithm is based on an adaptation of the null-space method for solving saddle point systems of equations, which may be of independent interest.

This study evaluates the efficacy of such measures by examining whether LLM capabilities can advance through algorithmic innovation in compute-constrained environments. We propose a novel framework distinguishing compute-dependent innovations--which yield disproportionate benefits at high compute--from compute-independent innovations, which improve efficiency across compute scales. The impact is quantified using Compute-Equivalent Gain (CEG). Experimental validation with nanoGPT models confirms that compute-independent advancements yield significant performance gains (e.g., with combined CEG up to $3.5\\times$) across the tested scales. In contrast, compute-dependent advancements were detrimental to performance at smaller experimental scales, but showed improved CEG (on par with the baseline) as model size increased, a trend consistent with their definition of yielding primary benefits at higher compute. Crucially, these findings indicate that restrictions on computational hardware, while potentially slowing LLM progress, are insufficient to prevent all capability gains driven by algorithmic advancements. We argue that effective AI oversight must therefore incorporate mechanisms for understanding, anticipating, and potentially guiding algorithmic research, moving beyond a singular focus on hardware. The proposed framework also serves as an analytical tool for forecasting AI progress.","authors":["Jack Sanderson","Teddy Foley","Spencer Guo","Anqi Qu","Henry Josephson"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04075"}

Existing methods are, however, either sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a \"soft\" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative solver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global optimality compared to previous works.

However, these powerful features also introduce a critical security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic black-box fuzzing framework, AgentFuzzer, designed to automatically discover and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus, then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentFuzzer on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentFuzzer exhibits strong transferability across unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses.

In this work, we highlight that a fundamental challenge in offline MARL arises from the multi-equilibrium nature of cooperative tasks, which induces a highly multimodal joint behavior policy space coupled with heterogeneous-quality behavior data. This makes it difficult for individual policy regularization to align with a consistent coordination pattern, leading to the policy distribution shift problems. To tackle this challenge, we design a sequential score function decomposition method that distills per-agent regularization signals from the joint behavior policy, which induces coordinated modality selection under decentralized execution constraints. Then we leverage a flexible diffusion-based generative model to learn these score functions from multimodal offline data, and integrate them into joint-action critics to guide policy updates toward high-reward, in-distribution regions under a shared team reward. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple particle environments and Multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks consistently.

Its extensive configurability enables area and power optimization, while a dedicated Tiny-OpenCL implementation provides a lightweight programming framework tailored to resource-constrained environments.

The prevailing path planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as lunar or Martian surfaces.","authors":["Tuba Girgin","Emre Girgin","Cagri Kilic"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09833"}

In our study, we examine how gender bias alignment influences fairness perceptions and reliance. The results of a 2x2 between-subject study highlight the connection between gender bias alignment, fairness perceptions, and reliance, demonstrating that merely constructing a ``formally fair'' AI system is insufficient for optimal human-AI collaboration; ultimately, AI recommendations will likely be overridden if biases do not align.","authors":["Domenique Zipperling","Luca Deck","Julia Lanzl","Niklas K\\\"uhl"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10661"}

We introduce the $(\\bm{K}, \\epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC), a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B, we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many \"weak\" heads, arithmetic and word problems share more consistently critical \"strong\" heads. Importantly, we find that each task maintains dedicated \"super-heads\" with minimal cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.","authors":["Pratim Chowdhary","Peter Chin","Deepernab Chakrabarty"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12268"}

The need for privacy protection in geospatial data analysis has become paramount due to concerns over the misuse or unauthorized access of client location information. However, existing private geospatial data statistics mainly rely on privacy computing techniques such as cryptographic tools and differential privacy, which leads to significant overhead and inaccurate results. In practical applications, geospatial data is frequently generated by mobile devices such as smartphones and IoT sensors. The continuous mobility of clients and the need for real-time updates introduce additional complexity. To address these issues, we first design \\textit{spatially distributed point functions (SDPF)}, which combines a quad-tree structure with distributed point functions, allowing clients to succinctly secret-share values on the nodes of an exponentially large quad-tree. Then, we use Gray code to partition the region and combine SDPF with it to propose $\\mathtt{EPSpatial}$, a scheme for accurate, efficient, and private statistical analytics of geospatial data. Moreover, considering clients' frequent movement requires continuous location updates, we leverage the region encoding property to present an efficient update algorithm.Security analysis shows that $\\mathtt{EPSpatial}$ effectively protects client location privacy. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that $\\mathtt{EPSpatial}$ reduces computational and communication overhead by at least $50\\%$ compared to existing statistical schemes.","authors":["Chuan Zhang","Xuhao Ren","Zhangcheng Huang","Jinwen Liang","Jianzong Wang","Liehuang Zhu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12612"}

A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling. The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain (MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.) benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance.

Existing approaches typically employ reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions, enhancing both training and token efficiency.","authors":["Penghui Qi","Zichen Liu","Tianyu Pang","Chao Du","Wee Sun Lee","Min Lin"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13438"}

Remarkable work has been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities, resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and localization of map elements, only point information is used without the consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation. And then, local features from point queries and global features from element queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local geometric information between points of the same element and of each point, Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points.

We begin by elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods, highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes. Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations.

However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational, and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs. These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in real-world contexts.","authors":["Prashanth Vijayaraghavan","Soroush Vosoughi","Lamogha Chiazor","Raya Horesh","Rogerio Abreu de Paula","Ehsan Degan","Vandana Mukherjee"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14971"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"SUS backprop: linear backpropagation algorithm for long inputs in transformers","abstract":"It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of backpropagation computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts back-propagation through most attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical transformer model, cutting about $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing $c \\sim 25-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about $1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when training a transformer model on long sequences.","authors":["Sergey Pankov","Georges Harik"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15080"}

This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's performance across typical TSP variants.","authors":["Long Wang","Jiongzhi Zheng","Zhengda Xiong","ChuMin Li","Kun He"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15862"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Distilling the Implicit Multi-Branch Structure in LLMs' Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning (which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving (which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model (GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime, unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.","authors":["Shicheng Xu","Liang Pang","Yunchang Zhu","Jia Gu","Zihao Wei","Jingcheng Deng","Feiyang Pan","Huawei Shen","Xueqi Cheng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16142"}

Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.","authors":["Yang Chen","Zhuolin Yang","Zihan Liu","Chankyu Lee","Peng Xu","Mohammad Shoeybi","Bryan Catanzaro","Wei Ping"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16400"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Bottlenecked Transformers: Periodic KV Cache Abstraction for Generalised Reasoning","abstract":"Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning (extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods; whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling alone cannot overcome.","authors":["Adnan Oomerjee","Zafeirios Fountas","Zhongwei Yu","Haitham Bou-Ammar","Jun Wang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16950"}

Despite their significant benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare, retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.","authors":["Rashed Shelim","Shengzhe Xu","Walid Saad","Naren Ramakrishnan"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17135"}

This capability effectively circumvents the challenges of mesh generation that traditional numerical methods face in high-dimensional or geometrically intricate settings. While recent studies have extended PINNs to manifolds, the theoretical foundations remain scarce. Existing theoretical analyses of PINNs in Euclidean space often rely on smoothness assumptions for the solutions. However, recent empirical evidence indicates that PINNs may struggle to approximate solutions with low regularity, such as those arising from nonlinear hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we develop a framework for PINNs tailored to the efficient approximation of weak solutions, particularly nonlinear hyperbolic equations defined on manifolds. We introduce a novel weak PINN (wPINN) formulation on manifolds that leverages the well-posedness theory to approximate entropy solutions of geometry-compatible hyperbolic conservation laws on manifolds. Employing tools from approximation theory, we establish a convergence analysis of the algorithm, including an analysis of approximation errors for time-dependent entropy solutions. This analysis provides insight into the accumulation of approximation errors over long time horizons. Notably, the network complexity depends only on the intrinsic dimension, independent of the ambient space dimension. Our results match the minimax rate in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, demonstrating that PINNs can alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the context of low-dimensional manifolds.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"FlowCut: Rethinking Redundancy via Information Flow for Efficient Vision-Language Models","abstract":"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but suffer from high computational costs due to redundant vision tokens. Existing pruning methods typically rely on single-layer attention scores to rank and prune redundant visual tokens to solve this inefficiency. However, as the interaction between tokens and layers is complicated, this raises a basic question: Is such a simple single-layer criterion sufficient to identify redundancy? To answer this question, we rethink the emergence of redundant visual tokens from a fundamental perspective: information flow, which models the interaction between tokens and layers by capturing how information moves between tokens across layers. We find (1) the CLS token acts as an information relay, which can simplify the complicated flow analysis; (2) the redundancy emerges progressively and dynamically via layer-wise attention concentration; and (3) relying solely on attention scores from single layers can lead to contradictory redundancy identification. Based on this, we propose FlowCut, an information-flow-aware pruning framework, mitigating the insufficiency of the current criterion for identifying redundant tokens and better aligning with the model's inherent behaviors. Extensive experiments show that FlowCut achieves superior results, outperforming SoTA by 1.6% on LLaVA-1.5-7B with 88.9% token reduction, and by 4.3% on LLaVA-NeXT-7B with 94.4% reduction, delivering 3.2x speed-up in the prefilling stage.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"SESaMo: Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation for Normalizing Flows","abstract":"Deep generative models have recently garnered significant attention across various fields, from physics to chemistry, where sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann-like distributions represents a fundamental challenge. In particular, autoregressive models and normalizing flows have become prominent due to their appealing ability to yield closed-form probability densities. Moreover, it is well-established that incorporating prior knowledge - such as symmetries - into deep neural networks can substantially improve training performances. In this context, recent advances have focused on developing symmetry-equivariant generative models, achieving remarkable results. Building upon these foundations, this paper introduces Symmetry-Enforcing Stochastic Modulation (SESaMo). Similar to equivariant normalizing flows, SESaMo enables the incorporation of inductive biases (e.g., symmetries) into normalizing flows through a novel technique called stochastic modulation. This approach enhances the flexibility of the generative model, allowing to effectively learn a variety of exact and broken symmetries. Our numerical experiments benchmark SESaMo in different scenarios, including an 8-Gaussian mixture model and physically relevant field theories, such as the $\\phi^4$ theory and the Hubbard model.","authors":["Janik Kreit","Dominic Schuh","Kim A.

To address this, we introduce STOPA, a systematically varied and metadata-rich dataset for deepfake speech source tracing, covering 8 AMs, 6 VMs, and diverse parameter settings across 700k samples from 13 distinct synthesisers. Unlike existing datasets, which often feature limited variation or sparse metadata, STOPA provides a systematically controlled framework covering a broader range of generative factors, such as the choice of the vocoder model, acoustic model, or pretrained weights, ensuring higher attribution reliability.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Done Is Better than Perfect: Unlocking Efficient Reasoning by Structured Multi-Turn Decomposition","abstract":"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are criticized for the excessively lengthy Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to derive the final answer, suffering from high first-token and overall latency. Typically, the CoT of LRMs mixes multiple thinking units; each unit attempts to produce a candidate answer to the original query. Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the unit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be explicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces Multi-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of explicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD, the model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces a thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can reflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking and answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more swiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning process (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn). We follow a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) then reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to realize MinD. We first rephrase the outputs of an LRM into multi-turn formats by prompting another LLM, and then tune the LRM with such data. Observing that the tuned model tends to consume even more tokens than the original one (probably due to that the multi-turn formats introduce additional answer tokens), we advocate leveraging RL algorithms like GRPO to prioritize correct outputs with fewer turns. Trained on the MATH dataset using R1-Distill models, MinD can achieve up to ~70% reduction in both output token usage and time to first token (TTFT), while maintaining competitive performance on reasoning benchmarks such as MATH-500, AIME24, AMC23, and GPQA-Diamond.","authors":["Zihao Zeng","Xuyao Huang","Boxiu Li","Hao Zhang","Zhijie Deng"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19788"}

We present the first comprehensive evaluation of commercial LLMs for assembly code deobfuscation. Testing seven state-of-the-art models against four obfuscation scenarios (bogus control flow, instruction substitution, control flow flattening, and their combination), we found striking performance variations--from autonomous deobfuscation to complete failure. We propose a theoretical framework based on four dimensions: Reasoning Depth, Pattern Recognition, Noise Filtering, and Context Integration, explaining these variations. Our analysis identifies five error patterns: predicate misinterpretation, structural mapping errors, control flow misinterpretation, arithmetic transformation errors, and constant propagation errors, revealing fundamental limitations in LLM code processing.We establish a three-tier resistance model: bogus control flow (low resistance), control flow flattening (moderate resistance), and instruction substitution/combined techniques (high resistance). Universal failure against combined techniques demonstrates that sophisticated obfuscation remains effective against advanced LLMs. Our findings suggest a human-AI collaboration paradigm where LLMs reduce expertise barriers for certain reverse engineering tasks while requiring human guidance for complex deobfuscation.

Central to the current reasoning studies, Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a fine-grained evaluation of intermediate reasoning steps and guide the reasoning process. However, extending PRMs to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces challenges. Since multimodal reasoning covers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting distribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to greater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM, therefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage. However, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from quality imbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for data selection strategy. To address the issues, we introduce DreamPRM, a domain-reweighted training framework for multimodal PRMs which employs bi-level optimization. In the lower-level optimization, DreamPRM performs fine-tuning on multiple datasets with domain weights, allowing the PRM to prioritize high-quality reasoning signals and alleviating the impact of dataset quality imbalance. In the upper-level optimization, the PRM is evaluated on a separate meta-learning dataset; this feedback updates the domain weights through an aggregation loss function, thereby improving the generalization capability of trained PRM. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks covering both mathematical and general reasoning show that test-time scaling with DreamPRM consistently improves performance of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Further comparisons reveal that DreamPRM's domain-reweighting strategy surpasses data selection methods and yields higher accuracy gains than existing test-time scaling approaches.

However, existing methods primarily focus on mimicking dialogues among roles in textual form, neglecting the role's voice traits (e.g., voice style and emotions) as playing a crucial effect in interaction, which tends to be more immersive experiences in realistic scenarios. Towards this goal, we propose OmniCharacter, a first seamless speech-language personality interaction model to achieve immersive RPAs with low latency. Specifically, OmniCharacter enables agents to consistently exhibit role-specific personality traits and vocal traits throughout the interaction, enabling a mixture of speech and language responses. To align the model with speech-language scenarios, we construct a dataset named OmniCharacter-10K, which involves more distinctive characters (20), richly contextualized multi-round dialogue (10K), and dynamic speech response (135K).

Reflection has emerged as an effective strategy for correcting erroneous trajectories in agentic workflows. However, existing approaches only exploit such capability in the post-action stage, where the agent observes the execution outcomes. We argue that, like humans, LLMs can also engage in reflection before action execution: the agent can anticipate undesirable outcomes from its own decisions, which not only provides a necessarily complementary perspective to evaluate the decision but also prevents the propagation of errors throughout the trajectory. In this paper, we propose MIRROR, a framework that consists of both intra-reflection, which critically assesses intended actions before execution, and inter-reflection, which further adjusts the trajectory based on observations. This design systematically leverages LLM reflection capabilities to eliminate and rectify erroneous actions on a more comprehensive scope. Evaluations on both the StableToolBench and TravelPlanner benchmarks demonstrate MIRROR's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to existing approaches.","authors":["Zikang Guo","Benfeng Xu","Xiaorui Wang","Zhendong Mao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20670"}

LLM deployers increasingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts. While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deployers and third-party developers can append additional prompts without visibility into others' additions, while this layered implementation remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises fundamental questions about how the position of information in different directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end, we compare how models process demographic information in system versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant biases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational, allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond the user's ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in commercial AI deployments.","authors":["Anna Neumann","Elisabeth Kirsten","Muhammad Bilal Zafar","Jatinder Singh"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21091"}

Current FaaS platform assume that each function invocation corresponds to a single event. However, from an application perspective, it is desirable to invoke functions in response to a collection of events of different types or only with every n\\textsuperscript{th} event. To implement this today, a function would need additional state management, e.g., in a database, and custom logic to determine whether its trigger condition is fulfilled and the actual application code should run. In such an implementation, most function invocations would be rendered essentially useless, leading to unnecessarily high resource usage, latency, and cost for applications. In this paper, we introduce multi-event triggers, through which complex conditions for function invocations can be specified. Specifically, we introduce abstractions for invoking functions based on a set of $n$ events and joins of multiple events of different types. This enables application developers to define intricate conditions for function invocations, workflow steps, and complex event processing. Our evaluation with a proof-of-concept prototype shows that this reduces event--invocation latency by 62.5\\% in an incident detection use-case and that our system can handle more than 300,000 requests per second on limited hardware, which is sufficient load for implementation in large FaaS platforms.","authors":["Valentin Carl","Trever Schirmer","Niklas Kowallik","Joshua Adamek","Tobias Pfandzelter","Sergio Lucia","David Bermbach"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21199"}

Some users evade censorship by deliberately disguising toxic words through homophonic cloak, which necessitates the task of unveiling cloaked toxicity. Existing methods are mostly designed for English texts, while Chinese cloaked toxicity unveiling has not been solved yet. To tackle the issue, we propose C$^2$TU, a novel training-free and prompt-free method for Chinese cloaked toxic content unveiling.

Driven by advances in deep learning, current audio steganography schemes are mainly based on encoding-decoding network architectures. While these methods greatly improve the security of audio steganography, they typically require complex training and large pre-trained models. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper pioneers a Fixed Decoder Network-Based Audio Steganography with Adversarial Perturbation Generation (FGAS). Adversarial perturbations carrying secret message are embedded into the cover audio to generate stego audio. The receiver only needs to share the structure and weights of the fixed decoder network to accurately extract the secret message from the stego audio, this eliminates the reliance on large pre-trained models. In FGAS, we propose an audio Adversarial Perturbation Generation (APG) strategy and design a lightweight fixed decoder. The fixed decoder guarantees reliable extraction of the hidden message, while the adversarial perturbations are optimized to keep the stego audio perceptually and statistically close to the cover audio, thereby improving resistance to steganalysis. The experimental results show that FGAS significantly improves the quality of stego audio, achieving an average PSNR gain of over 10 dB compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, FGAS exhibits superior anti-steganalysis performance under different relative payloads; under high-capacity embedding, it achieves a classification error rate about 2% higher, indicating stronger anti-steganalysis performance compared to current SOTA methods.","authors":["Jialin Yan","Yu Cheng","Zhaoxia Yin","Xinpeng Zhang","Shilin Wang","Tanfeng Sun","Xinghao Jiang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22266"}

Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments. With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interpretability of modeling. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the formulation, evaluation, and refinement of the model, facilitating the discovery of the model. We examine two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks achieve the coefficient of determination value R^2 close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover, on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors, offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.","authors":["Ahmad Anaqreh","Shih-Kai Chou","Mihael Mohor\\v{c}i\\v{c}","Thomas Lagkas","Carolina Fortuna"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23383"}

Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations.

Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However, while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness, they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over 10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods.

While existing methods have made progress in addressing corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second, we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.","authors":["Zeyuan Liu","Zhihe Yang","Jiawei Xu","Rui Yang","Jiafei Lyu","Baoxiang Wang","Yunjian Xu","Xiu Li"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23871"}

However, current hardware development for efficient SNN training lags significantly. No systematic energy evaluation methods exist for SNN training tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes an Energy-Oriented Computing Architecture Simulator (EOCAS) for SNN training to identify the optimal architecture. EOCAS investigates the high sparsity of spike signals, unique hardware design representations, energy assessment, and computation patterns to support energy optimization in various architectures. Under the guidance of EOCAS, we implement the power-aimed optimal hardware architecture through Verilog HDL and achieve low energy consumption using Synopsys Design Compiler with TSMC-28nm technology library under typical parameters.

Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.","authors":["Luiza Ribeiro","Alexandre Street","Jose Manuel Arroyo","Rodrigo Moreno"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24159"}

Readers are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions, leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English. Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface. Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia.

To address this, leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically, given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene. Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection.

Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance, outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels.

We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.","authors":["Lihao Sun","Chengzhi Mao","Valentin Hofmann","Xuechunzi Bai"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00253"}

In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.

We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \\emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \\textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.","authors":["Femi Bello","Anubrata Das","Fanzhi Zeng","Fangcong Yin","Liu Leqi"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00653"}

Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions (PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging scenes with complex light transport.","authors":["Pedro Figueiredo","Qihao He","Nima Khademi Kalantari"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00839"}

Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.","authors":["Qichao Wang","Ziqiao Meng","Wenqian Cui","Yifei Zhang","Pengcheng Wu","Bingzhe Wu","Irwin King","Liang Chen","Peilin Zhao"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00975"}

In this work, we introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization.

In this work, we revisit the framework of quantitative coarse graining and identify the orthogonality condition from Legoll and Lelievre (2010) as a key criterion for constructing CVs that accurately preserve the statistical properties of the original process. We establish that satisfaction of the orthogonality condition enables error estimates for both relative entropy and pathwise distance to scale proportionally with the degree of scale separation. Building on this foundation, we introduce a general numerical method for designing neural network-based CVs that integrates tools from manifold learning with group-invariant featurization. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we construct CVs for butane and achieve a CV that reproduces the anti-gauche transition rate with less than ten percent relative error. Additionally, we provide empirical evidence challenging the necessity of uniform positive definiteness in diffusion tensors for transition rate reproduction and highlight the critical role of light atoms in CV design for molecular dynamics.","authors":["Shashank Sule","Arnav Mehta","Maria K.

Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

We validate our formulation both experimentally and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"ADEPT: Adaptive Diffusion Environment for Policy Transfer Sim-to-Real","abstract":"Model-free reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful method for developing robust robot control policies capable of navigating through complex and unstructured environments. The effectiveness of these methods hinges on two essential elements: (1) the use of massively parallel physics simulations to expedite policy training, and (2) an environment generator tasked with crafting sufficiently challenging yet attainable environments to facilitate continuous policy improvement. Existing methods of outdoor environment generation often rely on heuristics constrained by a set of parameters, limiting the diversity and realism. In this work, we introduce ADEPT, a novel \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{E}nvironment for \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{T}ransfer in the zero-shot sim-to-real fashion that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to dynamically expand existing training environments by adding more diverse and complex environments adaptive to the current policy. ADEPT guides the diffusion model's generation process through initial noise optimization, blending noise-corrupted environments from existing training environments weighted by the policy's performance in each corresponding environment. By manipulating the noise corruption level, ADEPT seamlessly transitions between generating similar environments for policy fine-tuning and novel ones to expand training diversity. To benchmark ADEPT in off-road navigation, we propose a fast and effective multi-layer map representation for wild environment generation. Our experiments show that the policy trained by ADEPT outperforms both procedural generated and natural environments, along with popular navigation methods.","authors":["Youwei Yu","Junhong Xu","Lantao Liu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01759"}

This article provides an analysis of tweets from propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war, February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust, whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting and humanitarian aspects of the conflict.

Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have already been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. Our analysis identifies four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload-download-attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent the proposed attack methods. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful behaviors within the user's local environment-such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets-by deploying a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework against five leading LLMs. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current security ecosystem surrounding MCP servers.

However, current 3D HOI motion generation approaches heavily rely on predefined 3D object models and lab-captured motion data, limiting generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, HOI video generation methods prioritize pixel-level visual fidelity, often sacrificing physical plausibility. Recognizing that visual appearance and motion patterns share fundamental physical laws in the real world, we propose a novel framework that combines visual priors and dynamic constraints within a synchronized diffusion process to generate the HOI video and motion simultaneously. To integrate the heterogeneous semantics, appearance, and motion features, our method implements tri-modal adaptive modulation for feature aligning, coupled with 3D full-attention for modeling inter- and intra-modal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a vision-aware 3D interaction diffusion model that generates explicit 3D interaction sequences directly from the synchronized diffusion outputs, then feeds them back to establish a closed-loop feedback cycle. This architecture eliminates dependencies on predefined object models or explicit pose guidance while significantly enhancing video-motion consistency. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity, dynamically plausible HOI sequences, with notable generalization capabilities in unseen real-world scenarios.

While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores.

EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches.

To this end, we propose gated-rank adaptation (GaRA). GaRA introduces lightweight adapters into intermediate layers of the frozen SAM, where each adapter dynamically adjusts the effective rank of its weight matrix based on the input by selectively activating (rank-1) components of the matrix using a learned gating module. This adjustment enables fine-grained and input-aware robustification without compromising the generalization capability of SAM.

To bring clarity to this valuable sociological concept, this theoretical paper, informed by the concept's original definition and existing empirical research, proposes a more precise definition of opportunity hoarding and formalizes it through a computational model. For concreteness, the model focuses on one context: how White families can hoard access to advanced high school coursework from Black students attending the same school. Through simulations, the paper highlights the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of advanced course-taking opportunities emerges. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to traditional accounts, White actors do not need to engage in exclusionary behaviors to hoard valuable resources. Rather, through the byproduct of network segregation and class inequalities, opportunity hoarding can emerge even when individuals act in race-neutral ways -- a process I conceptualize as hoarding without hoarders.","authors":["Jo\\~ao M.

Traditional approaches such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) guarantee asymptotically unbiased samples from such distributions but suffer from computational inefficiency, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional targets, as they require numerous iterations to generate a batch of samples. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and scalable neural implicit sampler that overcomes these limitations. The implicit sampler can generate large batches of samples with low computational costs by leveraging a neural transformation that directly maps easily sampled latent vectors to target samples without the need for iterative procedures. To train the neural implicit samplers, we introduce two novel methods: the KL training method and the Fisher training method. The former method minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the latter minimizes the Fisher divergence between the sampler and the target distributions. By employing the two training methods, we effectively optimize the neural implicit samplers to learn and generate from the desired target distribution. To demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed samplers, we evaluate them on three sampling benchmarks with different scales.","authors":["Weijian Luo","Boya Zhang","Zhihua Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04952"}

The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.","authors":["Ali Rabiee","Sima Ghafoori","Anna Cetera","Walter Besio","Reza Abiri"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09448"}

The GPU accelerates the \"embarrassingly\" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones.

Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.","authors":["Nicolas Boull\\'e","Matthew J.

Such sequences rely on echo-planar imaging (EPI) to achieve reasonable scan duration. However, EPI is vulnerable to off-resonance effects, leading to tissue susceptibility and eddy-current induced distortions. The latter is particularly problematic because it causes misalignment between volumes, disrupting downstream modelling and analysis. The essential correction of eddy distortions is typically done post-acquisition, with image registration. However, this is non-trivial because correspondence between volumes can be severely disrupted due to volume-specific signal attenuations induced by varying directions and strengths of the applied gradients. This challenge has been successfully addressed by the popular FSL~Eddy tool but at considerable computational cost. We propose an alternative approach, leveraging recent advances in image processing enabled by deep learning (DL). It consists of two convolutional neural networks: 1) An image translator to restore correspondence between images; 2) A registration model to align the translated images. Results demonstrate comparable distortion estimates to FSL~Eddy, while requiring only modest training sample sizes. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to tackle this problem with deep learning. Together with recently developed DL-based susceptibility correction techniques, they pave the way for real-time preprocessing of diffusion MRI, facilitating its wider uptake in the clinic.","authors":["Antoine Legouhy","Ross Callaghan","Whitney Stee","Philippe Peigneux","Hojjat Azadbakht","Hui Zhang"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10723"}

Our method improves on node-specific fixed neighbor selection by allowing a variable number of neighbors, eliminating the need for external tuning data as the pruning parameters are derived directly from the affinity matrix. SC-pNA does so by identifying two clusters in every row of the initial affinity matrix, and retains only the top p % similarity scores from the cluster containing larger similarities. Spectral clustering is performed subsequently, with the number of clusters determined as the maximum eigengap. Experimental results on the challenging DIHARD-III dataset highlight the superiority of SC-pNA, which is also computationally more efficient than existing auto-tuning approaches.

Moreover, the choice of domain for computing attributions has often been overlooked. This work demonstrates that the wavelet domain allows for informative and meaningful attributions.

Recent approaches based on domain randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown great potential for single-source domain generalization by simulating images with randomized contrast and image resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSegbased methods in fetal brain MRI. Specifically, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture models employed in FetalSynthSeg outperform physics-informed generation methods in terms of OOD generalization. We further show that incorporating intensity clustering significantly enhances generalization in settings with limited label classes by producing more realistic synthetic data. By combining synthetic pretraining with fine-tuning on real images and applying weight-space interpolation between the two models, we propose DRIFTS as an effective and practical solution for single-source domain generalization. DRIFTS consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks and is, to our knowledge, the first method to achieve accurate brain tissue segmentation on fetal T1-weighted images.

Model-driven methods (e.g., Kalman, particle) presuppose full knowledge of the true dynamics, which is not always satisfied in practice, while purely data-driven solvers learn a deterministic mapping between observations and states and therefore miss the intrinsic stochasticity of real processes. Recently, score-based diffusion models learn a global diffusion prior and provide a good modeling of the stochastic dynamics, showing new potential for DA. However, their all-at-once generation rather than step-by-step transition limits their performance when dealing with highly complex stochastic processes and lacks physical interpretability. To tackle these drawbacks, we introduce FlowDAS, a generative DA framework that uses stochastic interpolants to directly learn state transition dynamics and achieve step-by-step transition to better model the real dynamics. We also improve the framework by combining the observation, better suiting the DA settings. Directly learning the underlying dynamics from collected data removes restrictive dynamical assumptions, and conditioning on observations at each interpolation step yields stable, measurement-consistent forecasts. Experiments on Lorenz-63, Navier-Stokes super-resolution/sparse-observation scenarios, and large-scale weather forecasting -- where dynamics are partly or wholly unknown -- show that FlowDAS surpasses model-driven methods, neural operators, and score-based baselines in accuracy and physical plausibility.","authors":["Siyi Chen","Yixuan Jia","Qing Qu","He Sun","Jeffrey A Fessler"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16642"}

A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial, HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event (e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator. However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.","authors":["Tomer Meir","Uri Shalit","Malka Gorfine"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01575"}

Continuous-time modeling introduces smoother transitions and refined control, hypothesizing enhanced solution quality over traditional discrete methods. We propose three key improvements to enhance the diffusion process. First, we transition from a discrete-time-based model to a continuous-time framework, providing a more refined and flexible formulation. Second, we refine the observation time scheduling to ensure a smooth and linear transformation throughout the diffusion process, allowing for a more natural progression of states. Finally, building upon the second improvement, we further enhance the reverse process by introducing finer time slices in regions that are particularly challenging for the model, thereby improving accuracy and stability in the reconstruction phase. Although the experimental results did not exceed the baseline performance, they demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in balancing simplicity and complexity, offering new insights into diffusion-based combinatorial optimization.

However, it is also of interest to establish lower bounds on the model class risk, for instance so that we can determine whether our fitted model is at least approximately optimal within the class, or, so that we can decide whether the model class is unsuitable for the particular task at hand. Particularly in the setting of interpolation learning where machine learning models are trained to reach zero error on the training data, we might ask if, at the very least, a positive lower bound on the model class risk is possible -- or are we unable to detect that \"all models are wrong\"?

However, this framework faces two main challenges: (1) the unknown value of each item, unlike traditional MNL bandits that only address single-step preference feedback, and (2) the difficulty of ensuring optimism while maintaining tractable assortment selection in the combinatorial action space with unknown values. In this paper, we assume a contextual MNL preference model, where the mean utilities are linear, and the value of each item is approximated by a general function. We propose an algorithm, MNL-VQL, that addresses these challenges, making it both computationally and statistically efficient. As a special case, for linear MDPs (with the MNL preference feedback), we establish the first regret lower bound in this framework and show that MNL-VQL achieves nearly minimax-optimal regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide statistical guarantees in combinatorial RL with preference feedback.","authors":["Joongkyu Lee","Min-hwan Oh"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10158"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Scaling Laws for Emulation of Stellar Spectra","abstract":"Neural network-based emulators for the inference of stellar parameters and elemental abundances represent an increasingly popular methodology in modern spectroscopic surveys. However, these approaches are often constrained by their emulation precision and domain transfer capabilities. Greater generalizability has previously been achieved only with significantly larger model architectures, as demonstrated by Transformer-based models in natural language processing. This observation aligns with neural scaling laws, where model performance predictably improves with increased model size, computational resources allocated to model training, and training data volume. In this study, we demonstrate that these scaling laws also apply to Transformer-based spectral emulators in astronomy. Building upon our previous work with TransformerPayne and incorporating Maximum Update Parametrization techniques from natural language models, we provide training guidelines for scaling models to achieve optimal performance. Our results show that within the explored parameter space, clear scaling relationships emerge. These findings suggest that optimal computational resource allocation requires balanced scaling. Specifically, given a tenfold increase in training compute, achieving an optimal seven-fold reduction in mean squared error necessitates an approximately 2.5-fold increase in dataset size and a 3.8-fold increase in model size. This study establishes a foundation for developing spectral foundational models with enhanced domain transfer capabilities.","authors":["Tomasz R\\'o\\.za\\'nski","Yuan-Sen Ting"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18617"}

Recent deep generative models are faced with challenges in geometric structure modeling. A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored area, which optimizes VLB as a path integral for SBDD. Our model effectively enhances molecular geometries and interaction modeling, achieving state-of-the-art PoseBusters passing rate of 95.9% on CrossDock, more than 10% improvement upon strong baselines, while maintaining high affinities and robust intramolecular validity evaluated on held-out test set.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Reinforcement Learning for Individual Optimal Policy from Heterogeneous Data","abstract":"Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find optimal policies in dynamic environments in order to maximize the expected total rewards by leveraging pre-collected data. Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods.","authors":["Rui Miao","Babak Shahbaba","Annie Qu"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09496"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Uniform convergence of the smooth calibration error and its relationship with functional gradient","abstract":"Calibration is a critical requirement for reliable probabilistic prediction, especially in high-risk applications. However, the theoretical understanding of which learning algorithms can simultaneously achieve high accuracy and good calibration remains limited, and many existing studies provide empirical validation or a theoretical guarantee in restrictive settings. To address this issue, in this work, we focus on the smooth calibration error (CE) and provide a uniform convergence bound, showing that the smooth CE is bounded by the sum of the smooth CE over the training dataset and a generalization gap. We further prove that the functional gradient of the loss function can effectively control the training smooth CE. Based on this framework, we analyze three representative algorithms: gradient boosting trees, kernel boosting, and two-layer neural networks. For each, we derive conditions under which both classification and calibration performances are simultaneously guaranteed. Our results offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for designing reliable probabilistic models with provable calibration guarantees.","authors":["Futoshi Futami","Atsushi Nitanda"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19396"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Leveraging Diffusion Models for Parameterized Quantum Circuit Generation","abstract":"Quantum computing holds immense potential, yet its practical success depends on multiple factors, including advances in quantum circuit design. In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\\\"urrutter et al. [1], our model effectively conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for accelerating and optimizing the design of PQCs, supporting the development of more practical and scalable quantum applications.","authors":["Daniel Barta","Darya Martyniuk","Johannes Jung","Adrian Paschke"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20863"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Higher-Order Group Synchronization","abstract":"Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.","authors":["Adriana L.

To support their claims, results on LibriSpeech and Common Voice are often quoted. However, this work finds that a substantial amount of the LibriSpeech and Common Voice evaluation sets appear in public LLM pretraining corpora. This calls into question the reliability of findings drawn from these two datasets. To measure contamination impact, LLMs trained with/without contamination are compared. A contaminated LLM is more likely to generate test sentences it has seen during training. Then, speech recognisers based on LLMs are compared. They show only subtle error rate differences if the LLM is contaminated, but assign significantly higher probabilities to transcriptions seen during LLM training. Results show that LLM outputs can be biased by tiny amounts of data contamination, highlighting the importance of evaluating LLM-based speech systems with held-out data.","authors":["Yuan Tseng","Titouan Parcollet","Rogier van Dalen","Shucong Zhang","Sourav Bhattacharya"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22251"}

Among many other capabilities, PyRigi can determine whether a graph admits only finitely many ways, up to isometries, of being drawn in the plane once the edge lengths are fixed, whether it has a unique embedding, or whether it satisfied such properties even after the removal of any of its edges. By implementing algorithms from the scientific literature, PyRigi enables the exploration of rigidity properties of structures that would be out of reach for computations by hand. With reliable and robust algorithms, as well as clear, well-documented methods that are closely connected to the underlying mathematical definitions and results, PyRigi aims to be a practical and powerful general-purpose tool for the working mathematician interested in rigidity theory. PyRigi is open source and easy to use, and awaits researchers to benefit from its computational potential.","authors":["Matteo Gallet","Georg Grasegger","Matthias Himmelmann","Jan Legersk\\'y"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22652"}
{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Contrast-Invariant Self-supervised Segmentation for Quantitative Placental MRI","abstract":"Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i) masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation.","authors":["Xinliu Zhong","Ruiying Liu","Emily S.

{"created":"2025-06-06","title":"Inter-Speaker Relative Cues for Text-Guided Target Speech Extraction","abstract":"We propose a novel approach that utilizes inter-speaker relative cues for distinguishing target speakers and extracting their voices from mixtures. Continuous cues (e.g., temporal order, age, pitch level) are grouped by relative differences, while discrete cues (e.g., language, gender, emotion) retain their categories. Relative cues offers greater flexibility than fixed speech attribute classification, facilitating much easier expansion of text-guided target speech extraction datasets. Our experiments show that combining all relative cues yields better performance than random subsets, with gender and temporal order being the most robust across languages and reverberant conditions. Additional cues like pitch level, loudness, distance, speaking duration, language, and pitch range also demonstrate notable benefit in complex scenarios. Fine-tuning pre-trained WavLM Base+ CNN encoders improves overall performance over the baseline of using only a Conv1d encoder.","authors":["Wang Dai","Archontis Politis","Tuomas Virtanen"],"url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01483"}
